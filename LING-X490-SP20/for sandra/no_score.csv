858482,"Should we send them to jail so the rest of their children can go into foster care? How about you?  Have you volunteered to become a Big Brother or Big Sister?  Are you a foster parent?

Are you a mentor for ASD students who have no stable adults in their lives? Since I've done some of those things, can I blame YOU for not doing your part to keep our society safe?
