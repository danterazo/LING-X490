Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids.

If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in """"confronting her directly"""". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was """"a joke"""", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar """"earth friendly"""" and """"cruelty free""""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.  There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating """"earth friendly"""" and """"human healthy"""" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and """"plantation-consciousness""""-wise, anyway.

Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens.

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.  It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to """"compensate"""" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.  Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.  Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion.

It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract. Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement. In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.  In sanctuary, it's a win-win for elephants and patrons alike! I have seen zoo elephants, and wild elephants in Africa.  It's disappointing that Metro is backing out of the reserve.

However, the SIP at Ainsworth is the dirty little secret of the Westside. It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!  How is this even compatible with the PPS equity initiative?

Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists """"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."""" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic.

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show.  Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.  I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better.

But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it.  Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice.

It is a bit snobby- as if the poor need middle class whites to tell them what they should want. And, for blacks and latinos, home ownership[ is pretty much their only chance for a nest egg.  Unless they are union they don't really get the jobs with stock options and generous 401k matches.  The fact that redlining once existed doesn't make the handful of black residents around Alberta less attached to their homes.  You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences.  Finally, I note you put a lot of trust in the people who own large apartment complexes to not exploit the inherent vulnerability that comes with being a renter.  The SFH gives people autonomy.  Yes, housing prices can drop, but so can any other investment.  Take my 401k- please...

First of all, I respect every students’ and parents’ right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any student’s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd.

Of course, if parents have reason not to trust that the school has their students' safety in mind, then I totally understand withdrawing from the school.  I'm just not sure where that distrust is coming from.

It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk. In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums. Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland’s growth into a unique and desirable city. Ref: bit.ly/23xnfC9 Ref: bit.ly/23xnD3L

Or what if they first write something like, """"Dog food tastes awful,"""" get a ton of affirmative replies, and then edit it to say, """"Dog food tastes great""""?  One option would be to put each corrected comment through the full peer-review process, but that would mean you'd need to rate three comments every time you wanted to correct a spelling error, which isn't a great experience.  This is one reason we give you the editable text field one last time when you're asked to rate your own comment (the other reason is that you might reconsider what you've written, having just been through the review process for other people's comments!)

People working to make positive change, Commissioners listening and using their judgement, the RG letting me know not only what happened but why.  It does bring worry to the mind, since, as Commissioner Bozievich said, at some point when the timber funds run out, Lane County is going to have to look for funding for many such projects. A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive.  It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them. Jobs are the answer to a lot of questions, including the massive homelessness problem. To transition from a timber receipts county to a strong county that has a lot of tax revenues and jobs from employment, that will take some real magic. Hugh Massengill, Eugene

It is time to move beyond the instinctive fear generated by media stories that do not tell the full story.  You will always be able to find singular stories that reinforce people's fears.  The cycle of fear is one of the underlying pillars of the system that leaves the US with the highest percentage of its citizens in prison of any major country.  Instead of focusing on that one outlier example of a releasee killing someone, wouldn't it be productive to look at the other side of the story, i.e. on situations where the release allowed folks involved to prosper and return to productive involvement with society.  I would love to see an in depth study looking not just at the instances that provoke fear but also instances where lives were helped by limited incarceration.

I did not comment on this particular case, I commented on our system exemplified by the subject case where a charge is levied likely without any physical evidence and in the end the reality of a crime or not a crime is determined only by who is believed.  I think objectively we or a jury can never know the truth in cases like this, the jury will most likely be voting their prejudices and personal world views.  You know a grand jury is a rubber stamp and an indictment via them carries no special validation.  Grand juries approve what 99 +% of indictments sought?  When it goes to trial, the trial jury will hear a person charge another with crimes having no physical reality in the current world.

I tend to place mental crimes at somewhat lower levels, mental crimes meaning that physical damage or loss is not the primary factor involved.  Many feel otherwise and place mental crimes right up there with murder.  In the present instance, however, I am trying to focus on how we know a crime has actually been committed.

On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively.  Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population.

I'll never understand why the people of Oregon agree to this medieval form of taxation.  Sales tax will never cause you to owe money to the government just by living you life.

When discussing urban development, the Sierra Club specifically says, “Land uses should be dense and mixed.”  Why does the Sierra Club take this position?  Well, its document tells us, although Mr. McDonald conveniently leaves out this important statement:  “Development shall be directed toward areas within UGBs, in order to avoid adverse impacts upon productive agriculture, wildlife habitat, critical watershed lands, historical and archeological resources, open space lands, and scenic values.”  Mr. McDonald’s column is a perfect example of why those in the neighborhood alone cannot decide the fate of the SW-SAZ.

Compact redevelopment should be promoted within one-half mile of high service transit nodes and corridors.” Of course, that leads one to the exact opposite conclusion that Mr. McDonald would have us believe that the Sierra Club supports because Willamette street and 29th is a high service node and corridor!

You pay more simply because you invested your money (that you already paid taxes on) in your home or land - which increased in value because of factors outside of your control.  Spend $100,000 building a boat, you pay no taxes on that.  If you spend $100,000 building a home on your land, you pay thousands of dollars in taxes, year after year.  You're better off with a 500sqft home and a 2000sqft yacht drydocked on your property.  Even though that sounds absolutely awesome, how much sense does it make?  Real estate is the only thing you get taxed on after you own it. It's the only thing you pay extra taxes on if you improve it while you own it. It's the only thing that has its value determined by the ones collecting the taxes.  Housing is also a basic human need.

As for gas for your car, maybe there is still a small one owner station with sales under $25 million but he for sure be buying from a distributor who will be adding it to his sales. Second, unlike an actual sales tax with provisions for resale - to prevent double taxation - the corporate sales tax could easily multiply.

Thus if we impose a higher corporate tax, the affected companies will immediately raise prices to maintain their profit margin or, if they cannot, they will go out of business or stop doing business in the state of Oregon.  Thus the corporate tax is simply a sneaker tax to extract money from John and Jane Q. Public citizens of Oregon.  Perhaps the corporate tax to help schools would be good.

So you are saying that a scientist does not understand science.  Okay, but I have fooled my peers.

Raise it to $12.50, the minimum of three tiered amounts passed  February 11 in Senate bill 1532, and those already making $12.50 will rightly  want a raise for their experience since new employees with no experience will now make as much.  Those businesses with lots of entry level jobs will cut staffing to keep expenses in line with income. Regardless of the minimum wage level, no business stays open long without profit.  That's the system we currently live with.  The new minimum is actually too low to cut public assistance for any but single member households.  A single and parent with one child, or a childless couple will still make less than the 185% of the Federal poverty level.

He reaches into his coat as he spins. This alarms the trooper who fires to kill. In that sense, LaVoy was set up to act instinctively. It was a fluid situation.  Was deadly force necessary? Was there another way to defuse him? What was he thinking when he was stopped, then fled away. Then he waited again to come out? He was in dialogue with his deeper self, in and not in conflict.

Several amendments fixed the slavery problem.  Another amendment fixed the women's right to vote problem, and so on and so on.

In both examples, the changes were effected via amendments; the 13th prohibited slavery and the 19th provided universal suffrage. No """"interpretation"""" on the part of any court was needed.

After all, anyone, including a judge, can interpret any constitutional clause any way he or she wants even if totally detached from logic and reality. (Perhaps we've seen this?) Rather, Judge Scalia's tenets of texturalism and originalism are what's needed; close adherence to the original meaning and intent of the Constitution.

Each one played high school and college football, and probably youth football, too; each was subjected to practices and standards that would be considered much more barbaric and dangerous from his playing days when compared to what occurs now. Each is a testament to the obvious, that not everyone who plays the game ends up damaged for life.  In fact, rare is the football coach who did not play the game himself. In Oregon's case, each of these 10 individuals now earns, when incentives are factored in, more than the president of the United States.

High power rifle rounds can go for miles.  If the woman was hit at a distance of a mile, it is not surprising that the shooters did not hear her cries for help.  It is surprising to me that she was hit with multiple rounds since at distance that would require very high precision shooting.  If the shooting was at short range, more serious charges may have been warranted.  Whenever I target shoot, I make certain to place the target in front of a big hill and never shoot with the barrel elevated beyond the base of the hill.

Software jockey's tend to think highly of themselves, but those of use who have started high tech manufacturing companies and such see the focus to be a bit misplaced.

Because they are cheap to start, we can get a lot of 'bang for the buck'.   Other companies is high tech manufacturing, food and beverage, and biotech have greater needs.  Many of the needs are infrastructure based.   We are also working on these components, but these take longer as the capital needs for these industries is greater.  This does not mean it won't happen, it just means it will take longer to align the resources to make it happen  The 'fanfare' is about education and getting the community to realize that in order for us to fuel our economy, we need to invest in things that will allow it to grow, and ensure the resources are here to support them.

From the comments here we see that readers make all sorts of conclusions without facts based on inferred but unsupported conclusions.  At 100 yards, the bullet's trajectory is mostly flat and if the bullet made it to the woman, the shooters likely were able to see her.

3909,0,"Excellent piece. People don't realize that it is ultimately the consumer who is pinched by these so-called business-only taxes; they are more or less pass-thru charges that hurt businesses (impairing their ability to compete with companies not exposed to the same taxes), workers (when costs of being in business go up, companies lay off workers), and consumers who pay higher prices for the same stuff as they did before.  Enough is enough. Perhaps the hostile tax environment may be part of the reason that the economy is so services oriented in Oregon. A lot of the Fortune 500 companies have left. The problem with such a services-oriented economy is that it is not very flexible. So, when economic downturns come around every 8 years, or so, the Oregon and other services-oriented economies (e.g. Arizona) is hit harder than the national average; a lot of the money used to pay for those services is sourced from discretionary income.  In recessions, people have less discretionary consumption.

The measure would probably result in an increase in taxes on the average company with more than $35 million in Oregon sales. Recent Department of Revenue data suggests there are fewer than 1,000 such companies in Oregon, and these companies account for a minority of sales in Oregon.  This measure would encourage smaller companies and companies with fewer transactions from production to retail sale, or at least smaller entities in between. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it counteracts a little bit of the advantage of big companies. The majority of the big companies that would pay the tax are out-of-state, so this measure would tend to keep more money within the state.  If food is too adversely affected, the legislature could change the tax for that industry.

While children are not a focus of some marriages, they are a focus of most marriages, especially during the 20 years or so it requires to raise a child. When a marriage fails or never even occurs and children are involved, it is a great moral failing of their parents with lifelong and even inter-generational consequences to them and their own offspring. More than any other factor it effects their income prospects and their likelyhood of having their own successful marriage. So while all the aspects Brooks mentions are crucial in choosing a good and lasting spouse, if children are expected to ever be a part of a family, that marital commitment must also be built around the children's needs and can be a great source of strength in maintaining marital commitment through difficult times.

I honor diversity and I really object to what Mr. Trump has said in public about Mexicans, Muslims, women, blacks, handicapped, and so on. I don't hate him, but I do seriously object to his candidacy for president of this country. I can't speak for others.  Furthermore, hating an individual can't be bigotry. Bigotry is about hating groups and collections of people for their characteristics, gender, background, color, religion, preferences, age, etc. Disliking a person, even hating that person, for what he or she says, believes, or does, rather than that person's classification, is not bigotry.

Having worked in tech all my life, the manufacturing operators and such who comprise so many of the tech workers tend to earn about 15-20/hour, far less than 105K/year.

Of course those folks would pass on even if they never used tobacco, but the controllers do not want you to think about that.  The cost argument.  Also nonsense.  Folks that have never smoked also experience medical expenses related to illness especially toward the end.  There is no evidence that smokers ultimately cost more than non-smokers.  I do not promote smoking.  I have never smoked (except behind the incinerator once in 1962 with the boys).

It is now considered one of the best systems for studying many aspects of development and disease, and Oregon gets a large amount of cachet for being the source of it.

Cellulose passes through your digestive system, aiding in the removal of waste from your body. This waste can include normal metabolic waste excreted in the bile, but may also include sugar and cholesterol if your blood levels are elevated. If you do not eat high-fiber food, your body continually reabsorbs excess sugar and cholesterol. Soluble fiber binds excess sugar and cholesterol in your intestines carrying them out of your body via solid waste. A high-fiber diet can improve heart and colon health and aid in weight loss. Cellulose is not digestible and serves no other purpose in your body aside from aiding in waste removal.

Imagine if the officers had deployed behind secure cover which in this pre-planned action was entirely possible.

The teaching portion of the faculty is cost effective in supporting the primary educational function of the University.  Research is a secondary function of the University and it is very expensive.

Those numbers are percentages, not based on total numbers. No woman who goes to a clinic gets either type of abortion with no screening.

In fact, other news reports that I have read have indicated that this other charge ( using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence ) has a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence ( much like the Arson charge the Hammonds were convicted of ), and a 10 year maximum. The Justice Department has determined that the seizure of the refuge was legally a violent act, despite the fact that no one was hurt.  I would expect a 5 year sentence on this charge, just like the Hammonds got. That is probably all that they will get.  And no less, due to the mandatory 5 yr sentence requirement.

You should check your facts, before making false statements like this.  http://www.fws.gov/refuge/malheur/visit/visitor_activities/hunting.html

Armed robbers especially should be given relatively short sentences so that there remains a very substantial margin between shooting and not shooting someone.  If the potential shooter knows that pulling the trigger costs a great deal (in terms of sentence), we win through lives saved. Drugs should be legalized.  The damage to society of locking up so many involved in drugs and engendering disrespect for the law is likely worst than that which would be associated with legalizing drugs .  While it may feel good to lock folks up for long terms, we pay for the good feeling.  Giving long sentences for simple property crimes, sex abusers, etc. removes the great divide between killing, the ultimate crime, and recoverable events.  With murder and sex abuse sentences similar, it is logical to kill the witness.  Sad consequence

Currently, our algal project is doing comparative sequencing of these species to determine if the sources of our resident species are from debris or from Asia or elsewhere around the globe.

However, here's the point, and the record is clear: quite soon after the minimum wage is raised, there's an immediate surge in inflation, which works to erode the increase in purchasing power, even totally negate that bump in the dollar wage.  Economists can make a pretty good case that the huge inflation rates we began to see in the early 1970s were triggered by that 1968 bump in the minimum wage.  Inflation is a great enemy of wage earners.  It destroys purchasing power.  Meanwhile, the """"Big Boys"""" get to use price increases, and be ahead.

At Universities there is typically great confusion between ideas and products.  An idea that will take years of research to reduce to practice is not a good basis for a company.  In fact, if there is any research at all left, it is likely that a company venture funded to sell potential product will fail.  Some start companies by selling the idea for a product.  If they are smart they can make a bundle from investors before the company fails as investors often cannot tell how far an idea is from being reduced to practice.

Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called """"white guilt"""" and """"politically correct""""  to ignore this economic based discrimination. Sanders would say you cannot begin to address prejudice until the injustice of the economic system is fixed.  So he seems insensitive to the Black Lives Matter.

Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.  Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.  Emotionally, i support killing those who resort to premeditated murder.  Rationally, I believe that each time we collectively kill we likely motivate and engender multiple killings between individuals who are simply applying what we collectively teach.

Neighborhoods also have more control over the social climate with more homogeneity. But it also requires large amounts of land, longer commute times (pollution and cost), longer bus routes, longer distances to provide city services and often a sense of isolation (some people like that). Compact growth saves arable land, encourages alternative transit, reduces pollution, increases a neighborhood feel, is less costly for city services, adds diversity and supports local retail.

Vinis has no experience as an elected official, and it appears she hasn't had any occasion to """"lock horns"""" with our City Manager and his staff. She simply has not demonstrated that she is adequately prepared to resist manipulation by the City Manager.  3. Lacking in relevant experience or even much exposure to city government, and seeming to have been picked as a proxy for another Piercy term, we can expect that Vinis will not sway from Piercy's agenda.  Vote for Vinis if you want 4 more years of Piercy and Ruiz.

Another indisputable fact is pollution travels the world free of source liability.  This means that emissions created in any one country travel to other countries, resulting in problems of an international issue.

There are too many unintended consequences for our community to simply choose one or the other.  I had been involved in several subdivisions, planned unit developments, in Eugene.  What struck me was the requirements for conservation, and lack of requirements for commercialization.  In other words, 40 acres in the southeast hills was developed without a single fire station, access to EMS or a grocery store.  Compare that with the prior Edgewood development which provided for schools and commercial stores and a neighborhood pool in the midst of Donald Street and Willamette Street.

Likely there were too many employees but the real problem is that there are way too many high-paid administrators. You could hire ~8 admins on what they pay one Vice Chancellor at the university, for example. So, for every 8 admins you fire - get rid of a Vice Chancellor and double your impact! As for the benefits that state employees get - they aren't that great for the newer employees. What's killing the state is the ridiculously generous benefits they gave to Tier I employees. Excellent retirement and 100% healthcare for the rest of their lives! You want a new nose - go get one, no problem. Finally, putting overly expensive speaker systems in classrooms isn't because teachers can't speak up - its because our school districts fall in love with every new technological gadget. The problem is the administration; and they are not going to cut themselves until they've decimated the workforce.

12196,0,"Just a thought here: What if our legislators viewed the budget gap with a strategic military view? They already have a mission statement, 'Close the budget gap'! Wouldn't it make sense to develop plans for an offense? Of course, along with offensive plans there would have to be contingency plans. Could it work to just put all possible solutions on the table, decide what the order of priority is for each one and start putting the plan together?  Everything wouldn't have to take effect immediately but could be triggered by some developed strategy or situation. Each could contain a sunset mechanism that would delete that option as required. You might even plan a retrograde operation that would be triggered based on described symptoms.  All I'm saying is that our legislators could do what the governor asks and propose a total plan, consisting of parts that would be implemented or deleted as required. It would take some serious work to get it done but it could be done! No political posture!

The federal Controlled Substances Act prohibits the recreational use of any scheduled drug. (How the federal government took control of drugs is a whole different issue for another discussion.) However, states did retain the right to decide what constitutes medicine and what constitutes a state crime.  So states that decriminalized marijuana and/or that designated it as medicinal were operating within the parameter of states' rights. So Nebraska and Oklahoma's challenge Colorado’s legalization of recreational marijuana failed because instead of arguing it imposed costs on their law-enforcement systems, they should have said it violated the federal CSA.  I predict such a challenge might work, so decriminalization of marijuana in general, and/or as medicine in particular, is the safest course, if you want to promote safe access to cannabis.

Gun People are true believers, many of which display all the hallmarks of a cult. Thus there is no reasoning or even level discussion about guns unless you are talking about caliber, knock down power or capacity.  I’ll add the note that I was once a card-carrying member of the NRA (since the age of 10) have hunted my whole life (I’m 67) and own so many guns I’m starting to unload them, no pun intended. I say once a member because the organization was hijacked by lunatics.""""  It's not abusive or racist. This points to a flaw in the new system; people can 'gang up' and reject a perfectly legitimate comment.

Alaska looks worse than a third- world banana republic.  And it makes those who argued that Alaska should be denied statehood look prophetic when they argued Alaska was too small, too corrupt to make a go of it.  We will begin replacing the thugs who have done this to us soon.

This research used data from 57 studies done across Europe, as well as in the USA and Australia, involving over 900,000 patients suffering from obesity.  In this study, they discovered that BMI - Body Mass Index, was by far the strongest predictor of increased mortality.  And that as BMI increased, so did the mortality rate.  So much so that people who were morbidly obese, risked decreasing their life span as much as 10 years.

Personally, I think the winning blow on the war on terror would for the US to totally and completely withdraw all military forces from the middle east.  Unfortunately, a variety of factors prevent our withdrawal.  One, we continue to guarantee Israel's survival and thus we must suppress Arab sovereignty to some extent.  We cannot allow Arab countries to gain power to threaten Israel.  We are locked in and the war on terror in large part derives from our commitment to Israel.  Another tie to the region is our desire to maintain a tame and compliant Saudi Arabia willing to supply cheap oil.  The war on terror stems from factors such as these which force us to deploy military might to maintain the status quo.  Ideally, we would leave the region and let stakeholders settle their differences.  Terrorism is just one price we pay to maintain the status quo.  There is no solution.
