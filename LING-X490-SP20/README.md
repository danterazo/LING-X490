This is an older version of the `abusive-language-detection` submodule, as it was when I finished the SP20 semester. I've made many improvements since then.

This code won't run unless you point it towards the `abusive-language-detection` submodule's kaggle data. Removed `data\kaggle_data` from root to save space.
