We should use offensive defensive strategy doctrine.learn lessons from Israel ..and give free hand to security forces and covert missions inside pak to bleed Pakistan.
India must prevent Pak soldiers to cross LOC and their coming into India stealthily at all cost. For that purpose we should use bullets liberally. At the same time, India should also slap a trade embargo on Pakistan, and urge and  convince the US and other powerful nations to introduce economic sanctions against Pakistan for an indefinite period. Then only this terrorist state would be brought down to its knees.
On the other hand Reliance Jio is giving for 3k - 3 months subscription to Unlimited calling (STD, Roaming), Unlimited 4G (this means actual 4G speed).

Let us accept the fact that We have a mini Pakistan here & many pro Pakistani anti national elements exists within the country. Which are being funded by enemy countries to weaken the integrity,peace & security of the nation by the help of few heavyweight traitors in politics. Be it in North- east, Kashmir or Hyderabad as long as a large section of fringe elements for their short term political or monetary gains prefer to destabilize the economy or national integrity following the support of external forces, resolving the issue of Pakistan or China will  be a distant dream for Mr Modi & his associates. Unless the rotten fishes are taken out from the pond we cannot expect a clean system.

Secularism means a democratic government run by majority numbers and minority power, as in our country.RSS is therefore running for majority and left/cong are running for minority power.Criticisimg each other is of no use.
Constitution has taken care of all aspects, bigots talk like this, if rulers of Rajas had thought, things would have different, humanity is Supreme, faith is personal, before 1947, there were more than 500 Riyasaths under Rajas and Nawabs, State of India was formed in 1947, uniting all small Rajas, diversity of India is strength of our country. So many people follow different ways of living, no problem,

Amazing !! Again Modijee became successful in polarising entire political fraternity , it looks like entire country is with Modijee for demonetisation and against him entire political system and all other political parties , no wonder, next 3 national government belongs to Modijee... Congress again is being fooled around and found itself on a wrong foot.. (there seriously is a deficit of a strong, wise, and intelligent leadership) Evidently it is a check-mate step by Mr Modi .. hats off to the Man..

Net banking and debit card are no more safe , Chinese hackers are trying to destroy Indian baking system , Indian ministerial cabinet has banned cell phones in the cabinet meeting in the fear of information being leaking , china is hacking all most every computer and phones , especially Chinese phones are most susceptible , foolish Indians have given Chinese companies entry to the telecom sector some of them are known spy companies , now to please Pakistan junta they are going all out to disrupt Indian economy , I am surprised that Indians do no even know that Chinese hackers were operating from Medan just 100 km from Indian shore located in Indonesia , if this is called BJp government cyber security management is it not a practical joke ?

This is @ $50 + per pod. In India, why don't they don't charge $75 per standard room? I ether pay that than $50 a day per pod. In the US, 3 star hotels range from $70-125. If you book it early or during promotion, you sometime can get it for $60 for double medium beds. Why is India so expensive and appear to have no land? Is it because it has a big population? I can see myself renting a pod in Japan or Hong Kong but not India.

The RBI should immediately withdraw the over the counter note exchange facilities and instead people be asked to deposit the cash in account and withdraw at the same time if they wish so.The long queues will stop immediately.The note exchange should be done only for those persons who are not maintaining accounts anywhere and that too with an undertaking that the person is not maintaining account anywhere and the cash  being exchanged so is for own use
Do not bother about boss mood at your level . For you Nation should be supreme. Taxpayers are paying you .Your boss is not paying you.

Respected Mr. Law MINISTER Sir, Kindly make it convenient to be initiated redressal of grievances pending yet. My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc. From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor.  During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department. On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC. I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.  I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court. Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear.  But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases.  After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression. I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI.  But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.  What we understand from the synopsis of plight-  Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.  My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account. Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family. Sincerely, Elembilayi Sadanandan, Vishnu Nilayam, Chovva,  Kannur, Kerala 670006. Mob 9388523453 9809274436. Email e.sadanandan@gmail.com God's Choicest Blessings be Showered on to all who go through and who reluctant to give justice or who had any role to suffering of mine.

Rather than giving like this why won't we give some fixed amount of money for every category of medal winners and invest the money on improving the other sports and facilities in India for our Athletes???? Our minister haven't giving any space for talent rather we see politics here as well. Unless we give up politics in sports we aren't assured of winning medals in 2020 Olympics as well :(

Margaux S Milchen.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary, Signed at Tripoli November 4, 1796, Article 11 has been established as a matter of contention between the English and Arabic translations of the Treaty.  Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the foundation upon which wording of Article 11 were based.  While it is true that Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights; both of which serve to further support Adams‚Äô words as being misconstrued.  That Congress unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when one acknowledges the whole translation issue.        John Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker.  In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s.  He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent  Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.‚Äù    In light of Adams‚Äô Christianity, it is highly improbable that translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed.  It is far more plausible that he was rejecting the claims of ‚Äúuniversal authority‚Äù proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything remotely dismissing the foundation upon the Christian religion.          Adams twice served as the Vice-President under President George Washington.  The words of our esteemed first President, included in his Farewell Address, further dispute any notion that these United States of America are not founded upon the Christian religion; ‚ÄúAnd let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.‚Äù  The words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution, clearly contradict the notion that America is not a Christian Nation; ‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù  While Puerto Rico is a territory of the U.S., they have yet to gain Statehood.  Indigenous languages have yet to take precedence over the English language in any of our States.  Your argument is a moot point until such time as they earn said Statehood.  We are all very much aware the U.S. is not Israel; restating the obvious is senseless, especially when it is irrelevant to the point at hand.  Perhaps it is you who ‚Äúshould read more?‚Äù

News from Jansatta
It's Factlble issue  ....
anna ji had taken the right decision,now we can see the real face of kejriwal.
Everything takes time!! We see the problem faced by all of us after demonetisation! But we ignore the fundamental problems and hardships faced by Indians due to ill practices before 8th! , thousands of farmers died, long lines at hospitals, poor quality of education! Is it easy to blame and point out deficiency but difficult to do what it takes to bring the change! We are all good opinion but not good option! If you have better solution to clean the system then write that!  Better schools, teachers and hospitals will be built when govt gets funds!  gst implementation after demonetisations will help in that!  Poor tax laws or justice system is not the result of PM Modi! But he is the only one trying to improve the institutions!  Corruption is in minds and also in operations! Which are being improved one by one! I'm not saying demonetisation is 100% correct but is is still a better step!  40% are poor and equally are uneducated! How do you suggest to solve that? With so much corrupt officials and politicians??

Here Azam Khan is pointing it out Modi's 'Dog' attack on Congress and not of his own. Being a Prime Minister of India , and keeping up the respect of the Chair he is holding, he should not go so cheap in the public. Never before any PM went to this level of low. It's OK as Road side Politician, but not as a PM of the country. Peeping into the bath room, using low level words, what kind of culture we are promoting? Please note here I am nit endorsing Azam Khan.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil.

Is it a fault that Anna Hazare has acknowledged some of the achievements of Modi. Those who are opposed to the BJP ideologies are supporting the other parties. Do anyone think that Kejriwal is having the right approach to the centre. The massive mandate he got in Delhi was taken for granted by him to abuse others. Is this attitude good for a person like Kejriwal. It is absurd to think that what he says is unquestionable and what he does is right. In my opinion his popularity is showing a downward momentum. Can anyone who is inclined to AAP  show a single political party in India which is having foolproof credentials.

I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.  The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.  After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.  The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.  When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.  Today i.e. On 23.03.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.  I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.

Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù,  ‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù   ‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù  If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us  India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face. China Claim South China Sea  China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly  Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off  India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty  If China Can Do For Their Mother Land  Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do) Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician. Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.  http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/223497-1105737253588/IndusWatersTreaty1960.pdf

When a pongy scheme (chit fund) is launched it always assures of higher return than normal ,even they repay for few initial customers to gain confidence , then when they acquire a big amount they close shop . The modus operandi is simply to cash on people's greed.  Similarly in this case also no matter how good marketing and business acumen one have , its not feasible to sell a product at 1/10th of its price . The catch over here is that delivery will be after 4 months , who knows if its a strategy to collect as much money and then close .

Cow in Hinduism:  Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.

I demand Modi G to deport all Muslims living in India as illegal occupants and court to withdraw all human rights to rights from Muslim living in India under enemy property act.

Lets not get into religious stuff. Your point on the technical quality of Bahubali taken, Sadat. But on religion, let us not even start a debate on ""uncorrupted"". Corrupting the minds of young children who do not even have the option to choose what is right and wrong, and putting them in front of a Quran to memorize is plain wrong and actually a form of child abuse. Even an ape can be trained to do something if he is forced to do it and not given any choice. Does that make an ape a Haji or an Imam? Nope. Give choices to your kids. And then let them decide which belief suits them.

To all those well educated indians talking about the poor people across the country .. my only question is .. how much are these poor people making that they will suffer ? I'm quite sure they aren't making 500 or 1000 bucks a day so how on earth will they save or need the bank to change 4500 bucks everyday ?? Unless they saved cash and now they need to change but how much is it at the first place ? Most of us just want to be keyboard warriors and just need a reason to hate .. this is great step taken by the BJP and it will help everyone in the longer run.

Dr. Raghu Ram Rajan was defenitely an intellectual and genius. That is the reason he became Indias RBI governor. But when it comes to performance, I think, he could not deliver what India expected of him. He took charge as RBI givernor when India was on a take off line. But the governor failed to press the accelerator . I think he was rather keeping his feet on the brake.  All genius are negatively oriented.

I am least interested in the windfall which is 1 lakh crores or 0 crores‚Ä¶ This demonetisation has changed the psyche of people on hoarding money. There will be in constant fear on hoarding even 2000 Rs notes. People have started moving to banking and started transacting thro digital payments and this helps expand tax base. People who transact thro banks will be eligible to loans. At present  poor borrow at 3-10% per month & they can move to banks for credit at 10% pa.   With GST indirect tax regime will be reformed and Direct tax regime reforms like taking out the exemptions are in process.   Tax rates for Registering lands should go down as NITI ayog is suggesting, so that everything can happen in white. Govt can use benami transaction act to prevent future frauds. Demonetisation is base for reforms.  Lata Venkatesh is highlighting only windfall gains of cash not deposited‚Ä¶..We need to look at long term health of the economy

As much as democracy is about peoples voice..i cannot believe this hatred against Yogi Adityanath. He is not a bad choice. My family has been his supporter. People and media are spreading so much hatred but he has done some great work!! There are so many videos on youtube justifying his great work. Watch this and everyone will change their mind.  https://youtu.be/aAjLxsDC0WU
What kind of media is this!!first they make headlines of indian soldiers being killed by rocket launchers n now about mutilating their dead bodies....this can happen only if Pak army crosses LOC....btw it looks like a #RealSurgicalStrike with evidences on indian media
(Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the state police chief seven months ago, and accessed by TOI, two 'recognised' religious conversion centres in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted as many as 5,793 people to Islam between 2011 and 2015. Conversions happening in unrecognised centres in the state could be much higher, fear top government officials who, for obvious reasons, didn't want to be named. The report states that almost half of those who converted to Islam are women, and that the majority of these women (76%) are below 35 years. Of those converted, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074 mostly Christian. The conversions happened at Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha at Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state 'authorized' to convert people from other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima -currently missing along with 20 others from the state and suspected to have joined Islamic State -says that a detailed inquiry is required to verify whether these conversions were under duress, whether there were enticements involved or were voluntary . ""Inquiries are required to know whether this will affect the communal harmony , internal security of the state and nation. A detailed SSB (state special branch) inquiry in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to unearth the details,"" the report, sent by then Kasaragod SP , A Srinivas, who probed the Nimisha case in November 2015, said.

When all this happened We have full sympathy for Sunil Grover.But now he is showing too much attitude. One thing must be noticed. Kapil Sharma had given full opportunities him during in his show.Mr Gulati had got much and much time on stage.credit must be given to Mr Kapil to give full chances to present Sunil,s talent. Now sunil thinks that he was God of this show.that is too bad. Whatever Kapil had done was wrong But whatever Sunil is behaving now it is too too bad.
Hi Anuj please share your view on UFO Movies is release of Bahubali is big trigger for company.
Dear all,,  Thank you for the support.  Kindly note our latest event with the FIA in Washington DC.  With trust, Dr. A Monica Dorhoi Chair of World Bank IMF Staff Meditation Club in Washington DC  [Updated] The Meditation Club meets with F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA)Foundation on Monday, January 11, 2016  Just updated ‚Ä¶ Thank you for inviting us, F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA)Foundation on Monday, January 11, 2016  Dr. Dorhoi attended on Monday, January 11, 2016 the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) Foundation reception at Marriott Marquis in Washington DC. She has previously worked for over 7 years in financing road rehabilitation worldwide. Dr. Dorhoi also works on both financing and managing risk in Formula 1 racing as part of the different financing requirements.  Thank you to F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) Foundation for preparing and publicizing the progress made in the implementation of the goals set by the ‚ÄúUnited Nations Road safety in 2015‚Äù. The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.  At the event the book ‚ÄúGoals for change, partners for action‚Äù the Annual report of 2015 of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA)Foundation was also featured.  The report enthusiastically embraces the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To be more exact, the energy goals for development translated into a Global Fuel Economy Initiative in which the foundation is helping governments to develop global and regional programs, to find evidence of effectiveness at national and city level, and to bring in donors to support the national policies and initiatives.  In United States about 40% of the traffic related deaths were reduced in the last few years. The 2020 United Nations Millennium Goals in relation to road safety are to reduce the deaths due to traffic by 50 %compared to today‚Äôs number.  For Dr. Dorhoi the connection with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) Foundation is blessed by her long time dedication to the causes of Ayrton Senna. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) is the organizer of the Formula 1 racing championships and Ms. Dorhoi, an American living in Washington DC in last 15 years has been a huge supporter for over 2 decades. Dr. Dorhoi is one of the greatest fans of the much beloved Formula 1 Racing Driver Ayrton Senna deceased in 1994 in San Marino. ‚ÄúThe tragedy truly marked me in an undeniable way.‚Äù  Dr. Dorhoi is also grateful to Alan Prost of France and Williams Renault for the sportsmanship after the loss of the driver Ayrton Senna.  [Additional information: Updated press release were disclosed at the event venue.]  Statement is posted at https://mdorhoi.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/the-meditation-club-meets-with-federation-internationale-de-lautomobile-fiafoundation-on-monday-january-11-2016/

Sensex would indeed touch 22,000.  In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.  Global events that will exacerbate the recession:  - IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+ - Euro will considerable depreciate  - BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU - US Elections and it's uncertainty. - Crude Oil Glut - China Debt-to-Equity conversion  - Shemitah year of 2016  A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+   Targets in the range on 2016-2018 (All prices are in Rupees  Sensex: 18000-19000 Nifty: 6200-6400 Bank Nifty:8500-9000 ICICI bank: 110-120 SBI: 95-105  Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet. You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor.   Sit on cash don't buy anything right now. Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.  Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016. Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative.

Anyway i dont know when this discussion became a girl vs boy argument. For me she is not representing India. She is there because of her talent not because she is from India. Sachin used to play for India in the Indian National cricket team so he does represent India exactly like Saina Nehwal or PV Sandhu or Sania Mirza when they play for India in a tournament where countries participate. Otherwise they are there cz of their talent

With due regards to all of you, very few person really knows the matter on the fraud committed by the Congress party, established by an English man and with Gandhiji, Nehruji and Patelji at its helm of affairs. Very few person, even judges and well known advocates do not understand that continuation of British enacted laws(like Cr Pc, Civil Procedure Code etc. all), passed at the London Parliament in our statute book is nothing but bestowing legitimacy and accepting illegitimate British occupation of India as rightful and legal. Very few people would agree that instead of celebrating Independence day as a day of festivity, we should observe it as a day of national shame.  Friends please note that we are still a dominion of British as per the Indian Independence Act, 1947, passed at the London Parliament read with Section 147 of the Constitution of India.

The situation of west Bengal has become terribly communal. I am from west Bengal. We have witnessed a number of communal riots taking place where majority of Hindus were molested, beaten and muslim illegal Bangladeshi immigrants ransacked Hindus residents, shops and religious temple. Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being targeted yet. We are living under fear as mamta government providing full support to these miscreants. Local Bengali medias are not not allowed to show the current situation of west Bengal. We urge central government to look into the matter seriously or else West Bengal will soon become mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. Mumtaz Beghum government is arresting any media channel which is trying to broadcast these muslim riots where they are butchering hindus.  At present, there is no problem in proper kolkata, but conditions in rural & small cities far from kolkata is changing fast.. search in google about tehatta, hajinagar, chandannagar , khagragarh , kanning ,malda , murshidabad etc etc ....even bangladeshi govt is now accusing west bengal govt for providing safe house for bangladeshi terrorists
Question for Mr.  Prakash Diwan... For Pricol and Granules India
Nice write up. However, before concluding that no gains are in sight, let us keep our eyes open and look for the gains which are overlooked in this article.                                                                                                                                      1)This could still be a paradigm shift. Don't forget that currency has been growing rapidly in our economy. In the words of former RBi governer Subbu Rao ""going up by 15 percent year on year since financial year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the previous three years.Even increase in e-transactions does not sufficiently explain this increase in demand for currency, suggesting that some other dynamic was at play. The Government‚Äôs surprise move was evidently in response to this uncharacteristic expansion of currency in circulation, clearly out of line with the pace of expansion of economic activity.""  This trend would definitely be arrested if the govt. is serious and continue its efforts sincerely. And the economy could see much lower cash in circulation.                                                                                                                                   2) temporary squeeze in cash is pushing many to move into electronic payments. Convenience and efficiency  will make them move away from cash permanently wherever possible.                                                                         3) With much less cash in circulation, black money locked up in land and gold would not be easily converted into cash. This could reduce the illegal activities too                                                                                                                        4) Lower land and apartment prices would benefit economy eventually                                                                                                       5)All the 12lakh crore reported to be put back into banking system has left a trail. Tax authorities can trace them and this could increase the cost of doing business via parallel economy.

What about the daily serials hammering into the head of fantasies, irrational and unreal life situations, even sometimes portraying women as headless spectators [both sexes], or collaborators and masterminding criminal acts within families units. This is what is killing the Indian minds in many ways. Instead of educating the society towards realism, fake situations regresses the minds, taking longer to adapt reality into life, not mentioning creating opportunities and ideas to commit crimes. Then, maybe all this is just modern living....... a living room reality.Even amnesia appears to be a norm in Indian society, according to the soaps.

With the presidential elections around the corner, talks of opposition parties coming together to upset the ruling BJP-led NDA have gained momentum.  At a gathering on late socialist Madhu Limaya‚Äôs 95th birth anniversary here yesterday, opposition parties discussed the possibility of forging a grand alliance by burying their differences to challenge the BJP in the presidential election. The opposition believes that a dent to the BJP‚Äôs chances of getting their man of choice appointed to the top constitutional post would come as a huge setback for the ruling coalition ahead of 2019 polls

y.   Indian Army band performs in Drass    WHEN WAS THE WAR FOUGHT?  The Kargil war, which commenced on May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants into Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control (LOC). The intrusion into the area, that divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern areas of the state, had come as a complete surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to flush our enemies from the Kargil sector.   Pakistani soldiers    MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK  Pervez Musharraf, the then Army Chief of Pakistan, is said to be the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully charted out the intrusion plan, without any specifics from the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by Leiutenant General Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf executed the plan while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore declaration.   Conventional modes of war were used    MODE OF FIGHTING  Well-equipped with war weapons, both sides were prepared to launch attacks on one another. The 18,000 feet high-altitude battle in the rocky terrain was fought under extreme low temperatures, in a conventional manner, despite both sides possessing nuclear weapons. India positioned five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops to Kashmir and further deployed 60 frontline aircrafts.   Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army and air force officers salute at the India Gate on Vijay Diwas    THE INDIAN AIR FORCE  On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be joined by the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, it was stressed that the IAF would not cross the LOC at any cost. The IAF launched bomb attacks on the enemy within its boundary. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil area of the state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India recaptured Tiger Hill and pushed the Pakistani forces back into its territory.   School children display a national flag over a displayed Indian army tank to commemorate the day    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT  Pakistan's infiltration to India and the military clash were deeply criticized by many countries and attracted the United States' intervention into the crisis. As per a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India gained the confidence of the US while Pakistan 'lost its credibility in the eyes of both India and Pakistan'. The international community began building pressure on the Pakistani forces and threatened them to withdraw or face isolation. Russia and Israel also came forward to support India's stance.

Hi Sonia congrats. And wish you good luck for your baby
So India is trying to say that Pakistan did a surgical strike and went back safely.  I smell some foul into it. India has a huge presence of army at the border. How come Pakistani army did surgical strike n Indian army had no knowledge of it. How Pakistani went back safely.   It all happened at a time when Turkish President was advocating talks on Kashmir....   To me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it. All this was done to get sympathy from US president Bill Clinton who came to advocate talks on Kashmir...!

Bollywood should promote to make women centric films to stop objectifying female to strengthen the thought process of the youth and not just about body. It's a need to glorify many live examples there where a woman has lead the complete mass for the excellence to show she is no more less than a man but where she is less it's with a proper reason of nature. But fake feminism should also not rise.

What SRK Did Next Will Make You hate Him Even More  A few hours ago, prominent Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan displayed his tolerance widely on Twitter. He blocked a prominent Baluchistan leader Dr. Mahmud Baloch from following him on Twitter. The reason was simple ‚Äì he had directed a few tweets towards Shah Rukh Khan asking his support to the blazing Baloch issue in Pakistan.  However, instead of helping or simply ignoring him, SRK ‚Äì as he is famously known as ‚Äì chose to put a full stop to him on his virtual media.  http://theindianvoice.com/a-baloch-activist-asked-srk-for-support-on-issue-of-pak-atrcoties/

Statistics of phone freedom251.  291rs per phone. (251+40rs shipping) x 6L order per second = 17.46 cr  It was taking order till 12.15pm approx I.e 6 hrs and 15 min which is 22,500 seconds  17.46 cr per sec x 22,500 sec = 3,92,850 cr  3,88,494 cr was turnover of reliance industries in year 2014-15  That means within 6 hrs  15min they crossed turnover of reliance  Within 6 second tax audit become applicable to that company  And if we calculate interest on the said amount per day  3,92,850 cr x 4% x 1/365 (by taking minimum interest rate) = 43.05 cr  And if after 4 months they will say we are unable to give product and refund 291rs to everyone 43.05 cr x 120 days approx = 5,166 cr  They will earn within 4 months by way of interest  Now you will say about their promotion cost  Deduct 50L,1 cr, 5 cr or even 50 cr, that will not make much difference to the figure

Attention: Indians have launched a False Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è Operations .   They claimed that Pakistani forces infiltrated the LOC killed and mutilated bodies of two BSF jawans .   The claimed location is not just heavily mined and fenced but has been under constant Indian Army surveillance citing attempted infiltration by Kashmiri Militants .   It's obviously an attempt to sway the international community away from the atrocities committed by Indian Occupation Forces on Unarmed Kashmiris.  Previously the Drama was done to fool Indian population for UP Election this time God know what they have in Mind but it's simply Evil and in the end people of India will suffer one way or the other.

I grew up with respect for cow, I started understanding the its value too for its milk, for giving us the bullocks for our agriculture. Now I live in the west but has never eaten beef because I respect that Indian cow with which I grew, spent my childhood, my youth . Though today the cow in Punjab is only milking cow as the bullock are gone from our villages, tractors have replaced them but still the farmers respect cow. So I will request my Hindu brothers not to use force, killings Muslims to force them to respect cow, change their taste not to eat beef but turn to other type of meat, chicken, fish,  vegetation food, win them over with your argument not force, violence has never won & will not. India will be divided further with hate, violence, aggression. Learn lesson from our past history, if we divided others will rule us. I love India, it is my pride, it is my honour.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government

(Koran 2:256) ""Let there be no Force in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in God hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And God heareth and knoweth all things""  (Koran 4:19) O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good""  (Koran 2:87) ""We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.

Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).""

A local commanders level hotline contact was established at Rawlakot- Poonch sector on LOC last night between Pakistan and Indian Army authorities. Indian counterpart was told that there has been no CFV from Pakistan side nor mutilation of Indian soldiers bodies. Indian authorities were told that there is unnecessary media hype following the allegations. Pakistan remains fully committed to maint peace and tranquillity along the LOC and expect same from other side and hope prudence is exercised and no steps are taken that may lead to vitiating of environment and affect peace along LOC. A Routine DGMO level hotline is also likely today.

Cow in Hinduism:  Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism. Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù  Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù  Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù

Sensex would indeed touch 22,000.  In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.  Global events that will exacerbate the recession:  - IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+ - Euro will considerable depreciate  - BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU - US Elections and it's uncertainty. - Crude Oil Glut - China Debt-to-Equity conversion  - Shemitah year of 2016  A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+   Targets in the range on 2016-2018 (All prices are in Rupees  Sensex: 18000-19000 Nifty: 6200-6400 Bank Nifty:8500-9000 ICICI bank: 110-120 SBI: 95-105  Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet. You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor.   Sit on cash don't buy anything right now. Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.  Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016. Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative.

The situation of west Bengal has become terribly communal. I am from west Bengal. We have witnessed a number of communal riots taking place where majority of Hindus were molested, beaten and muslim illegal Bangladeshi immigrants ransacked Hindus residents, shops and religious temple. Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being targeted yet. We are living under fear as mamta government providing full support to these miscreants. Local Bengali medias are not not allowed to show the current situation of west Bengal. We urge central government to look into the matter seriously or else West Bengal will soon become mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. Mumtaz Beghum government is arresting any media channel which is trying to broadcast these muslim riots where they are butchering hindus.  At present, there is no problem in proper kolkata, but conditions in rural & small cities far from kolkata is changing fast.. search in google about tehatta, hajinagar, chandannagar , khagragarh , kanning ,malda , murshidabad etc etc ....even bangladeshi govt is now accusing west bengal govt for providing safe house for bangladeshi terrorists

It was appalling to hear two very senior army generals Gen Bikram Singh and Lt Gen Panag criticising tying of a stone pelter on the vehicle to save lives of amost 25 people including CRPF and Police men. Both these generals claim to have groung experience but have moved away from ground reality. My heart goes out to the young officer who thought of this ingenuine method to save own as well as civilian casualities. All Kashmiris are innocent after the event and claim HR Protection. But when do they realise the same for the uniformed men ? They are also sons of this country. I wish yuo stop callingthese gentlemen for future debates.

Dr. Maanmohan Singh ji's statements today:  1. ""Demonetization is organized and legalised loot"" I am still wondering if 2G and coal scam was not. 2. It is a Monumental management failure. I am still wondering if MANREGA was not. 3. He also quoted John Kynes"" In d long run we are all dead"" Is that why he let his goons like Raja, Vadra and Kalmadi to loot d country with land, defence, mines and spectrum scams during his tenure because d future is dead?Aren't u d person who killed our future by choosing not to open your mouth then?
They were killed by RPG and artillery fire from  long distance than how come Pakistani soldiers can mutilate their bodies?? It doesn't make any sense. it is just an other headline grabbing exercise by Indian Army in order to impress Turkish president...Erdagon made a statement earlier that he wants Pakistan and India to resolve Kashmir dispute.

Why doesn't the govt invest some of this money in improvising training facilities in all sports? And all the money they are giving is the commoners money that we pay as tax! Shouldn't the Govt ask the people of the Nation before making this decision? What about the athletes who made to the finals n athletes who participated? Shouldn't they be encouraged too??? Injustice prevailed n still prevails!

Laughable comments. India is not the same country anymore. Lata Venkatesh and Udayan did their best to create panic in the minds of investors by showing a very gloomy outlook. However Indian market and investing community is smarter than ever to let go the buying opportunity available . Media should grow up now and do a balanced analysis than playing the devil's advocate all the time.
Hope the markets are illuminated during trading hrs & index hits a new high in the near future.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. still you Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government panty GANG

Its a done deal. Steve Jobs got ousted from Apple. Mistry ain't no Steve Jobs. Mistry getting the boot is painful but there is never a easy way to deal with firing high level executives(HUGE EGOS). Safeguarding your reputation becomes important for both sides and that is what is playing out here. It is a waste of time speculating the correctness and legality of the firing as Ratan Tata( seasoned warrior) has been around for a long long time and will not make rookie mistakes.
No body is going to pay you attention when louder choices are thundering
USA, UK, GERMANY, FRANCE and many other countries follow state religion, while they allow other faiths to coexist. However laws of the land are strictly followed regardless of ones religion and no concessions are given. None of the Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Iran, etc., have churches or temples but in the guise of secularism India has given Muslim followers unlimited liberties of loud sparks for their calls to prayers, subsidies to travel to Macca Madina and various other financial helps. Yet this community, many of them, are dissatisfied. In that case Indian govt should allow them to migrate to Pakistan Banladesh or any other. Muslim country which will take them. Those who support secularism, can also try and emigrate to other countries of their choice if they will be accepted. Creators of constitution have committed biggest blunder and its interpreters of this secularism are propagating this blunder to help their vote bank which is a great shame.

I'm really proud to have him.  He was the best central banker of India.  People compare him to Reddy.  Well the world wasn't in the shape it is in today.  Secondly the world wasn't printing money at this rate and trying to weaken their currencies.  I respect Rajans stand on reserves , refusing to give banking licences to industrialists and stability of currency. His giving new licences to new banks shall also force new leaders to take the stage.  Look at how indusind bank and yes bank have performed when compared to sbi,  Icici,  hdfc bank.  Very well done sir.  I'm going to cry the day you leave.  Thankfully a lot of Indians are no longer idiots and have the guts to back you.

Neel your comments are good but can you argument with Bhakts?  Because they can't see they just belive what he says. What he said about Congress every Bhakt knows that they are corrupt,  but what he said about jobs and 15,15 lakh in every Indian account , these bhakts don't  ≈ôalk √†bout this and they don't  ask also. This gauraksha and triple  talaq are nothing but diverting the attention  from real issues.  Note bandi effect will come next year. Tale bani rule has come into India in the form of gaurakshak.

Latest statement of Pak Army A local commanders level hotline contact was established at Rawlakot- Poonch sector on LOC last night between Pakistan and Indian Army authorities. Indian counterpart was told that there has been no CFV from Pakistan side nor mutilation of Indian soldiers bodies. Indian authorities were told that there is unnecessary media hype following the allegations. Pakistan remains fully committed to maint peace and tranquillity along the LOC and expect same from other side and hope prudence is exercised and no steps are taken that may lead to vitiating of environment and affect peace along LOC. A Routine DGMO level hotline is also likely today.

Sub:- Like of 29/11 attacks can‚Äôt be stopped without solving Kashmir problem which can‚Äôt be solved without end-game in sight.   -----In the entire history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times than Pakistan especially India with better level of advance in science & technology as is evident from ‚ÄòMangal-yan‚Äô the Mars mission] cowardly & helplessly tolerates repeated humiliation by way of armed aggression on it. India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India‚Äôs partition is yet to be written.    One more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‚ÄòSainik‚Äô laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‚ÄòMoksha‚Äô through ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‚ÄòSati‚Äô because their husbands got ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‚Äòmadhosh‚Äô husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land].   This culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‚Äòkeede-makode‚Äô (insects) and at the top of it are called ‚ÄòShaheed‚Äô (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)    But in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‚ÄòUnited India Party‚Äô which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India.   It is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-       http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html   [Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]  Regards  Email: hemraj_jain@yahoo.com

Since I am neither a follower of RSS nor Gandhiji, I am not a right person to judge.But killings/violence/wars are normal part of humans life history.We should accept this fact first ,and feel happy .

Everyday new rules and regulations are introduced by a Income tax department, the finance ministry, the revenue and other bureaucratic secretaries and RBI and all the rules and regulations are arbitrary, unlawful and intended to create harassment to the public at large. There is stiff competition amongst all these authorities in issuing the rules and regulations which can cause harassment to the public.
Cyrus Mistry had to go. Do not know what is the legal way. One good reason is UK Steel fiasco. Ratan Tata is a welcome soothing senior statesman till things settle.

Eyeing Indian Open Title, PV Sindhu Has Something New Up Her Sleeve
I think the police should bring in modern police sedans as used in the USA having a camera recording everything and a computer connected to a central crime database so that everything is recorded on camera. Also, put as much as CCTVs on public transport vehicles so that everything is recorded on camera and hence no eye witness is needed to put perpetrators behind bar on the basis of solid evidence. Also, if any Government official/ servant/ officer is accused of molesting and outraging the modesty of a lady, then he should be suspended immediately and if found guilty be dismissed from Duty. I know the laws are there but the implementation of such laws are very weak. Also, I think the media should keep highlighting the politicians that have criminal cases of rape and molestation against them so that the parties are finally forced to take action on such dirty politicians and kick them out of the party

Srinagar : 1 Security Personnel Killed, 11 CRPF Officials Injured In Grenade Attack
Congrats Dipa ! We feel very proud  of you .
#ieWorld | The officials said one of those shot is a minor, and none of the injuries is life-threatening.
From pre-2014 , We have heard the thumping of 56"" Chest with promise to abrogate article 370 and famous ""10headsForOne"". BJP is in power both at Center and State, the Big mouth for first  two years rejected UPA's ""no talk and undeclared tit-for-tat  policy"" that had Kashmir situation under near normal and started hobnobbing with Nawaz in chai pe charcha. Today Kasmir is worse than ever, intrusion and terror attacks are substantially up and Indian reaction are the same empty words. Shame on this Government which neither has any Kashmir policy nor knows how to secure Indian borders and security personnel nor establishments even after 4 attacks on highly secured Security establishment. This is the most impotent, imbecile Government ever.
Problem lies in the Govt, they have only lied and fooled people.

Some suggestions 1) Like aadhar card make it mandatory to have ATM/Debit Card. 2)Every business outlet small or big shall have swiping machines/paytm like arrangement. It must be made mandatory to run business. 3)Stop printing Rs.2000/_ immediately. And in future Rs.500/- . If not demonitize them six months before every election. All elections hence shall be conducted on the same date henceforth. 4)like indirect taxes integration, integrate all direct taxes & collect them through transaction tax from bank as arthakranti suggested.  5) Continue cash withdrawal restrictions even after Dec 31st. 2016. Reduce cash usage eventually and limit to Rs.5000/- per month to individuals and Rs.20000/- to 100000/- to businesses as per their turnover. 6) Gst shall be collected at first billing. Stop input credit and collect turnover tax basing on turnover of distribution, service providers, and other small businesses.   More in later dates......

Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all used to think but he is just another corrupt politician who has worn the mask of ""Harbinger of Good days"". Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points.  When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank... But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I think he has cheated all of us... Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern.. I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP??  Please realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at he border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM... Jai Hind.....

Are MPs not public servants. PM Narendra Modi says that he is prime servant of the country.

Welcome Sir Please kindly make it convenient to be spared my experiences as a Self Employed Er. Entrepreneur : My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc. From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor.  During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department. On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC. I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.  I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court. Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear.  But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases.  After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression. I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI.  But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.  What we understand from the synopsis of plight-  Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.  My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account. Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family. Sincerely, Elembilayi Sadanandan, Vishnu Nilayam, Chovva,  Kannur, Kerala 670006. Mob 9388523453 9809274436. Email e.sadanandan@gmail.com God's Choicest Blessings be Showered on to all who go through and who reluctant to give justice or who had any role to suffering of mine.

That means they accepted that they forcefully occupied Tibet and that makes some Chinese official sympathized with the Tibetan people for brutality and oppression they face thereafter. It is welcome news and hope China Free Tibet and live as good  neighbour for long time benefit for both.

I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.  The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.  After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.  The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.  When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.  Today i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.  I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.

We should never dream for anything to achieve in  future ? we must make smaller goals accordig circumstances. Ones Goal is achieved we must proceed for next Goal and so on. As our expectatins may change according situations in life. We live in society with our family . Our first responsibility/ priority  is to live happily in present. Dreams may come and go & can be changed . Your concentration must be on your immediate Goal to achieve. Dream should not be the ultimate Goal but it is illusion. Goal isrel situation /present which you are facing.

Tata Motors is on upward cycle with the launch of the Tiago and the Hexa and the upcoming Nexon and Kite.

Septembar 2017 should be considered for GST Implementation instead of April 2017 or July 2017 as OPEC is looking to reach $75/bl & May 2017 OPEC meeting will give clear signal regarding this which is interlinked with upcoming TRUMP Economic policy as a whole or in relation to China. May be China already fall in line with Trump by cutting down Steel Production in mid level !! Impacts of these highly interlinked activities on Indian Economy will only be cleared around the month of around Aug, 2017. Till then it will be best if GST waits for Sept'2017 instead of hurrying ‚úî

The Almighty shall never forgive those who are responsible for killing innocent civilians. No religion endorses such a criminal act. Unfortunately there are people who carry out such barbaric acts in the name of religion. India will never forget the death of 257 innocent people who fell prey to the terrorist attack that took place in Mumbai in 1993. The injured are undergoing treatment. Pakistan had been all along denying the presence of the most wanted Criminal in their country,  but the truth has ultimately come to light. This has once again proved that Pakistan is responsible for vitiating the atmosphere of India with the help of criminals who were provided shelter in their backyard.

Mr Jaitley has to do some balancing  acts in view of the upcoming assembly polls.The union budget is not expected to be entirely corporate friendly.The govt. is considering waiving off interest on loans taken by farmers .A marginal rise in train fares is likely  as the govt. is considering providing social security to coolies who constitute unorganised work force. More than 70 percent of indirect tax collections  has come from the oil and gas sector which has seen rise in international prices.The govt. should stop announcing immunity for black money hoarders any more as frequent announcements of immunity raises question about the strength of govt.'s enforcement machinery.

A negligent driver is prosecuted and punished for killing a person by car / truck. The organizers / management of public functions / utilities are prosecuted and punished in case of fire due to negligence in which people get killed. Similarly the authorities / officials of Government and Reserve Bank of India should also be prosecuted and punished for negligence about demonetization which has allegedly killed ~ 70 persons, as mentioned at:-   http://www.alwihdainfo.com/Opposition-protecting-Government-and-RBI-from-prosecution-under-Section-304-A-IPC-etc_a45304.html     It is expected that Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha will take this matter to its logical / legal end and would get justice to the victim and her family, relatives and friends by getting the GOI & RBI (and hospital authorities) prosecuted for negligence etc about illegal demonetization program which has caused this death of the lady.

Rcb today win the  match
Big deal !
two post destoried . indian tank went in side pakistan and killed 7 soilder.
Attention: Indians have launched a False Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è Operations .   They claimed that Pakistani forces infiltrated the LOC killed and mutilated bodies of two BSF jawans .   The claimed location is not just heavily mined and fenced but has been under constant Indian Army surveillance citing attempted infiltration by Kashmiri Militants .   It's obviously an attempt to sway the international community away from the atrocities committed by Indian Occupation Forces on Unarmed Kashmiris.  Previously the Drama was done to fool Indian population for UP Election this time God know what they have in Mind but it's simply Evil and in the end people of India will suffer one way or the other

In UPA if some MP had criminal background there will be a big TRP debate in shameless media, now anyone dares to talk about Amit Shah That explains why Indian media is 2nd corrupt in the world and India has moved down in corruption rating in 2016 God bless India if god exists

Sensex would indeed touch 22,000.  In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.  Global events that will exacerbate the recession:  - IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+ - Euro will considerable depreciate  - BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU - US Elections and it's uncertainty. - Crude Oil Glut - China Debt-to-Equity conversion  - Shemitah year of 2016  A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+   Targets in the range on 2016-2018 (All prices are in Rupees  Sensex: 18000-19000 Nifty: 6200-6400 Bank Nifty:8500-9000 ICICI bank: 110-120 SBI: 95-105  Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet. You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor.   Sit on cash don't buy anything right now. Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.  Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016. Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative.

Cow in Hinduism:  Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism. Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù  Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù  Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù

If you introspect, then one question comes in mind...who is responsible for all these ? Pakistan or India. For answer..one thing comes in mind...if a mad dog starts biting you on and on....what will you do..you will attack and kill the dog or you will slip away silently to a hospital to be treated and do away nothing with simply condemning. FOLKS...just think of Pakistan about their bravery for barbarism and our so called liberal Indian government for becoming a mere spectator and condemnation.

The numbers just announced by honourable Finance Minister are on expected line. But the real phase has just begun from this current month. The sustainability is directly linked with the Credit Growth in MSME, IT & Agriculture sectors & all just mentioned three sectors are infused in each other in any ELECTRONIC ECONOMY. It is now remain to be seen how much Banking Industry & Govornment can give in TIER 2 & TIER 3 & TIER 4 cities/towns by massively simplifying MSME, COMPANY & CREDIT LAWS in next 6 months.

Worst BANK... and all customer care executive including Customer Service Manager (Chairman & MD Cell) MR. RAVI M. are extremely ignorant and they are dealing customers as if they are running a grocery shop.  Just imagine.. 16th of March I received mail from him sayingDear Mr. Customer,  We acknowledge receipt of your below e-mail received at the office of the Senior Management.  The reference number for this interaction is APW-0316-862-BG. We have noted your concerns and we shall reply with the status within 4 working days.  Should you have any further concerns on the same issue, kindly write back to us using this same email ID and reference number.  We appreciate your cooperation and patience in the interim.  Warm Regards, Ravi M. Customer Service Manager (Chairman & MD Cell) Regd. Office : HDFC Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank House, Senapati Bapat Marg, Low   And till date he has not replied even after 2 reminders... even deputy manager at chennai division Nagarajan Narayanan Jebasundersingh Devasahayam Ravichandran Vaidhyanathan all had replied to mails like blinds.... I am asking for a reason of delay and all these ignorant customer care officers replied , ""you card was delivered."" Completely out of context of the mail that was sent to them . No accountability this BANK has. Obviously that cannot be expected if Mr. RAVI M. (Service Manager of Chairman Cell ) is sleeping and has not lived upto his committments in last 2 months (almost).  WORST BANK AND CUSTOMER SERVICE...!!!!!!!

The Indian Express tracks a food packet, from the kitchen to the berth.
So India is trying to say that Pakistan did a surgical strike and went back safely.  I smell some foul into it. India has a huge presence of army at the border. How come Pakistani army did surgical strike n Indian army had no knowledge of it. How Pakistani went back safely.   It all happened at a time when Turkish President was advocating talks on Kashmir....   To me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it. All this was done to get sympathy from US president Bill Clinton who came to advocate talks on Kashmir...!

I also liked that you were saying there is no much impact on seeds buying for Rabi and rural economy will be gud but these media people under the compulsion of showing some headlines always ask questions repetitively till they get answers the way they want it. In media no body will look at their channel if they don't make big headlines and keep discussing this event for months. In Summary good analysis !! all the best !!

*Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President.*  First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:  Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.  CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.  Trump: The Democrats created them.  CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.  Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.  CIA: We can't do that.  Trump: Why is that?  CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.  Trump: I don't care.  CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.  Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.  CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.  Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.  Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.  Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.  Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.  Trump: Why not?  CIA: We are talking to them, sir.  Trump: What? Why?  CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.  Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.  CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.  Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?  CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.  Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.  FBI: We can't do that.  Trump: Why not?  FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.  Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.  Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.  Trump: Why not?  Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?  Trump: I am banning H1B visas.  USCIS: You cannot do that.  Trump: Why?  Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.  Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???  CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest! üòÇüòÇ

Indian Stock markets seems to be highly over valued, no reason to be optimistic, monsoon likely to be weak below normal, hence corporate earnings will continue to be under pressure, sharp drop in oil prices and strengthening rupee against US dollar will affect exports and manufacturing and service sector, no new investment, no capacity expansion no new big manufacturing factories, banking system in disarray mounting bad debts, agriculture sector in slump, no chance of any improvement of Indian economy,

Why is the inflation on numbers given by government is unrealistic when compared to the actual prices of commodities in the retail market. Is the government bluffing too much to hype economic progress to attract investment ?
RBI took nice initiatives to cleanup the bad loans.. this should impact on our entire national economy.. and drop-down in inflation to that extent..

He just popped up without an invite as a surprise.. he even waited at the gorakhnath mandir for hours before entering the on going HYV meeting from where he was thrown out. He has no place to go and is trying his best to get into the BJP. So don't just judge everything by what's been posted in brief. He is never going to be allowed into the party looking at his stature and also his father being a samajwadi party loyalist.
I think he should stay silent for few years üòÄ

Kevin Gaskin.  You're most welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but you'll not find anything about ""separation of Church and State"" contained in any of them.  Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as had been done by Washington and Adams before him. The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between church and state,"" which led to the erroneous ‚Äòshort-hand‚Äô for the Establishment Clause (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.      ‚ÄúWhy do I have a freedom of religion‚Ä¶?‚Äù  The answer lay in the Congressional papers as they pertain to our Constitution as we know it today.  The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions.   ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù  This intent was well understood, as evidence by court rulings after the First Amendment.  In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù   One must realize that our Founding Fathers were striving to attain ‚Äúfreedom of religion‚Äù due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  It wasn‚Äôt only Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism.  Our Founding Fathers set about to recognize the many denominations of Christianity.  Further, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, as opposed to granting power of control by any one denomination.  Herein lay the misinterpretation of the reckless ‚Äòshorthand‚Äô known as ‚Äúseparation of Church and State.‚Äù    A more accurate statement is likely ‚Äúseparation of denominations of the Church and State.‚Äù  Such interpretation is wholly supported by the Congressional papers in reference to the statement, ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù  As for the statement, ‚ÄúMost of our founding fathers were agnostic,‚Äù that is simply not true.  It is a blanket statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general.  Yes, there were agnostics in those days but they were not nearly so prevalent as claimed.  Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.  Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.  John Adams is another erroneously accused of being agnostic.  Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.‚Äù  I believe you‚Äôll agree his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel any claims of his agnostic beliefs.
Lokanathan Rajan so? The govt shouldn't even try? Such defeatist mentality as yours is the reason that India still lags behind as a third world country, rather than having realized its potential as the world's leader

Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù,  ‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù   ‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù  If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us  India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face. China Claim South China Sea  China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly  Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off  India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty  If China Can Do For Their Mother Land  Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do) Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.

She is eyeing the CM's chair.As the old English saying 'History repeats itself'goes ,after the death of MG Ramachandran ,his widow Janaki Ramachandran was appointed CM for a brief period before Tamil Nadu was brought under President's rule in February ,1988.Late MGR's loyalists tried to cut late Jayalalitha to size without success.The rival party DMK won the state assembly elections in 1989 but their rule lasted only for two years before the then Prime Minister on the advice of Jayalalitha imposed President's rule again on the state.Jayalalitha led AIADMK won the 1991 assembly elections and she was sworn in as Chief Minister .If Sashikala Natarajan  tried to take over as CM then a split in the party is imminent.

I am not sure this particular analysis is any special or better. On the contrary, unlike normal, there are too many assumptions without base. She is one among the few I have been listening to for any worthy serious fundamental discussions. But this one is an odd.  Right now, everything points to one central pivotal figure: How much money is coming back?  Until we have updated authentic figures on a daily basis, we wouldn't be able to tell anything at all. The 2.1 Trillion incoming of Nov-27-30 is still an unreliable figure with belies logic. Could it be possible that this was just the inflow of deposits (of which a part could still be SBN Notes) that was popping into the huge salary accounts as usual on every month end? As for how to do with a special dividend, there can be umpteen ways to find a solution as long as RBI's soul owner is Govt. of India.

Yes thats my point too. Money is not the issue but political advantages are. This way or that way there are loop holes in everything. May be so much money was allotted  but was it used effectively? No one knows.  I just hope that every athlete is honored the same way like the winners. It would be an inspiration n encouragement for next generation of athletes.  Most of the talented athletes come from under privileged, poor socioeconomic background. They fight odds to represent our nation internationally they deserve respect n appreciation too.

‚ÄúIt is important not to convert political fight into mere clash of personalities as the BJP and NDA regime are trying in order to divert focus from their policies administrative failures,‚Äù Singh said. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said that the policies of NDA government is challenging the Constitutional principles. The need of the hour, he said, is to pit ‚Äòpatriotism against RSS nationalism and counter Hindutva nationalism with Indian nationalism‚Äô.  In recent past, there were some signs that opposition parties were serious considering coming together to challenge the BJP-led NDA.

Cow in Hinduism:  Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism. Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù  Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù  Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù

I just don't understand why PM Modi himself doesn't take any step. I have seen just statements of all the politicians, before and after the elections, nothing has changed. PM Modi should either take control of Home Ministry or appoint new Home minister

'vaidya shaala'/ ‡§µ‡•à‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ - THE RIGHT WORD Certain biblical & other terms were modified by Christian Missionaries to sound as if Indian, in order to penetrate their religious activities.

Most of the times People like CM and other VIP actually do not know about such incidents, they unknowingly share events with people.

all the information about both olympic medal holder are wrong....

V) Being human 1 lakh Vi)Andhra govt 3 crore. vii)Dehli govt 2cr. viii) Indian olymic 30 lakh. ix) Nita ambani 50 lakh n car.... and much more from all state govt of India..... so its more than 30 cr....
Yes, India is crying for an Olympic medal . In fact, we have become undignified in the comity of sovereign nations. Priding ourselves as the largest   Democracy in the world. Soldier's is different one and genuine of course. Raise the issue separately. It will be like pulling each other's leg. If anyone jealous may become sportsman not soldier.

Param Pujye Sadgurudevji is innocent and Bhai Shree Mandeep Nagpalji is also innocent, i don't think that having a personal life with personal money is not good, Gurudevji has never told anyone to stop practicing their religion and follow him, he never told anyone to stop any-kind of bad habits, i know Mandeepji form years and i can bet it that he cannot drink, if someone likes having cars it is not bad if he has purchased with his personal money,I am seeing him form years he helps everyone and he is a very charitable person, and what IndiaTv is showing is he is a very bad guy & gurudevji takes money form people for his luxury it is not like that the money which Gurudevji takes from people is for charitable activities and for building a temple in Vrindavan so that the Sanatan Mariada keeps existing.

So many are struggling, suddenly bringing out demonetization does hint towards ulterior motive.  Demonetization is not bad at all, but should have been better implemented.
I love you bolo tu call me

a) Karan neither has a niece nor a nephew who is a part of his company. Even aunts/uncles for that matter. And as a matter of fact, he has nurtured the likes of Nikhil Advani who did not belong to a filmy family. His crew has a lot of first generation professionals too. Shahrukh, Preity Zinta, Sidharth, Anushka, Fawad Khan, to name a few have featured in his movies in prominent roles. So the argument of nepotism is weak in my view.  b) What you also need to understand. Karan runs a production house and the nature of work/hierarchy is very different than that of the usual corporates.  c) Karan invests money into a film and as the creative head of his company, he has every right to cast whosoever he feels fits the bill and can contribute to the success of his film/attract audience. And like someone rightly pointed out, it is talent that will sustain at the end and if his choice of cast fails to impress the audience, it is his loss and as a businessman in the movies, he is smart enough to understand that dynamic. d) Lastly, he has never shied away from praising the outsiders' work. In fact he also has no qualms in admitting that he is incapable of making certain kind of films that he thinks are brilliant and made by outsiders. His friendship with Anurag Kashyap is very strong and Kashyap has admitted how wrong a perception he had had about him just like many others until he came to know him.

Who to cast in a movie is Karan's prerogative, like it or not. If he feels he only wants to have big stars in his films, it is his choice and rightfully so. And if he chooses to launch star kids, again, it is up to him. One cannot raise objections with that, unless, he is discouraging the entire film fraternity from casting ""outsiders"". That would have been a problem.

Why govt. is launching new notes than making policy to do electronic transaction only if transaction amount will be above than Rs. 10000. Now we have capacity to go with cash less. Govt. is telling big notes are causing and big reason of black money and same time launching even bigger notes so both statements are contradicting itself. It will be better if they just block big notes and just issues more small notes of Rs 1-100 for small transactions. Controlling blacking money with such poor steps, never work until take full well planned policy. The one who have black money in banks, anyway will get new notes so nothing will change for them.

Interestingly, more people are interested in abusing NDTV for reporting this incident (not to mention the fact that others are reporting about this incident too) and blame Congress which is not in power to avoid any reference to BJP which is power in both the state and centre.

There is more rhetoric tha facts and analyses in what this gentleman says.  For example, he speaks of India of a thousand years ago when he refers to Gandhara and so on as integral parts of India. It amounts to mere mumbo jumbo when one speaks in that style because there is no precise way in which you can direct your efforts. That is the problem with the so called ultra-nationalists: they appeal to emotions and not reason.
If we go through the indian political history Anna is just miniature of Mahatma Gandhi & Jay Praksh Narayan..
@ravishankar prasad-No Pain no gain...They did pour in  a lot of sweat and effort to earn that money..Our politicians steal 100's of crores from the general public but nobody will talk about dying soldiers when this happens.

Dr. Raghu Ram Rajan was defenitely an intellectual and genius. That is the reason he became Indias RBI governor. But when it comes to performance, I think, he could not deliver what India expected of him. He took charge as RBI givernor when India was on a take off line. But the governor failed to press the accelerator . I think he was rather keeping his feet on the brake.  All genius are negatively oriented.

It is very good atleast this excess liquidity will be in safe place with Rbi as crr which also earn from commercial bank interest from rbi ( i don't know the present int.rate pays by rbi). Otherwise the commercial bank would hurriedly try to give loans to various chambal dakus industrialist and again the same will go as npa after some years and next govt will ask the bank to clean the bank balace sheet. why this excess liquidity not kept as a permanent crr which was introduced in the Indira gandhis time for one time (like from 9th november to march 31.2017) any excess deposit will be treated as one time crr and will attract int of 4.5 to5 pct when bank pays 4pct for savings aact

Business environment in India is not conducive for rapid growth with several factors like inflation, political, monsoon, geographical etc acting as speed breakers. One should be realistic & not expect bumper profits from even better known companies in the near future. This is the consolidation phase & an great opportunity to churn your portfolio into blue chip names which may be available at reasonable valuations whenever there are large fluctuations in the markets. More weightage should be given to companies that pay handsome dividend & are consistent in their performance.  Pharma & good IT names could outperform in the days to come.

This is all over India. No respect for small vehicles even if they are in their own track. Also in cities every one is in the middle of the road regardless of what speed they r. It is a driving descipline which was never followed all over. This is the primary cause of noise pollution due to use of sound horns. Strict rules and enforcement of law as well as track usage based on vehicles etc to be strictly enforced. India need only two track in highways if proper driving descipline is maintained.  If we dont follow then we pay more toll for more tracks increased traffic and noise pollution, etcetc goes on..

Just because Ethiopian cuisine has the lentil pancakes doesnt mean its any more or less like Indian food.

Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù  Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù  Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. THE GREAT LEADERSHIP

Till now GoI has been following the theme of Development through Policy Reforms without giving much thoughts about system's functional reforms. System's functional reform needs digitisation with time scale removing random authorisation or hold up feature. Current status reveals that Digital India lacks time scale. Moreover, till now GoI resists itself from populist policies as populism & development do not go hand in hand. And here GoI has find itself in Catch 22 position for 2019. As peoples elect Government to lessen their pain not for elongation of it. Now if GoI sticks to Development then it has to apply Time Scale as mentioned just with Digital India or if they opt for populism then they will have to drastically bring down scope of Digital India as the count down for 2019 has begun. Next General Budget 2017 (not 2018 or 2019 due to lack of budget implementation time as original benifits of every budget one can get or feel only after 1 & 1/2 years ! )   is going to be most crucial for BJP led NDA GoI‚úî

Neel Patel I agree with you that They cheat people. I'm surprised to hear from a Gujarati.

But BJP is full of criminals and they cheat common people and stand with corporate and make people Fools. They promised jobs, Unemployment rate has gone high. It is said they are looting money by selling fuel at a high price and Corporate debt is cleared by the tool called demonetization.
