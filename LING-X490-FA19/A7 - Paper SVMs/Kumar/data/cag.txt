Wondering why Educated Ambassador is struggling to pay through Credit/Debit at a Decent Restaurant! Cant imagine that diplomat of a Developed nation is not having a Card and he needs Cash only for Dinner.
Not good job.....this guis creating a problem n our socacity
absolutely! the deeper you dive the shallower cushion you have .
Brown Sahib , anti national leftist commies , media and Muslim pandering Hindu sick-O-Lars have milked ""secularism"" to all it was worth to render it into a mere failed slogan . Sick-O-Larism has been nothing more than continuation of British policy of ""divide and rule"" . That RSS is opposed to ""the idea of secularism"" , absolutely  because it has been used as a dagger into the heart of Hindus , Hinduism and Hindustan .
For tht those hv more thn 2 flats or 2 land is legal rest has to surrender properties to govt
This problem is occur only in India not in other countries?
In government office implement the online transactions... also all parties should show off their account transaction for running their elections in RTI.
Unfortunately this is wat indian govt is capable of doing!!!!...i dint vote for modiji to see such crap..
People talk about common man suffering all the time.This is the same country where thousands laid their lives for freedom.Cant the common man endure little trouble to stand in queues for the greater good.
I visited 5 atm but I cont able to withdraw from money..not working..
Modi ji,  all the Pain & n√∂ Real Gain.
Hell with BJP. All political  parties are corrupt and I do not like anyone. They are there to only make money whomsoever you may vote.  But supporting Naxalites who kill our soldiers,  taking side of JNU students who shout ""Bharat ke tukde Katenge"" and Afzhal Guru tere Katil jinda hai and very recent ""there is nothing wrong in chanting Pakistan zhindabad "" are all attributed to this man. Hence he is decidedly antinational.
udhav has shown bjp its place,bravo shivsena
Unebeivable atory. Some time back India was wrongly claiming surgical strikes in Pakistan and now claiming surgicam strike  by Pakistan. Wrong again.

I'm not a salman fan mate but i think you are a fan of zee news nano chit in 2000 notes and lets not talk about intellect here coz people who have low intellect judge people based on their choices
But lynching was never a part of the freedom struggle but how can the chaddis who were always chamchas of the British know that?
Dear India,  stop playing with the emotions of your people for votes.

Ask the khans to do it... Any ways they kill them when drunk.... And then start with being human
You can be sure that the gunman was a white American (christian and not a muslim), otherwise the headline would read ""muslim"" and not ""Beer-drinking"" as the first word.  There would be more calls for Trump's  ""muslim ban"", which the world's laughing stock has failed to implement - but will the great Orange One now call for a ""Beer-drinking ban""?
If you cannot do any good for your country   at least support those who are trying to do something better for country. Today whole world recognise India just because of Modi.
man what's with you people copy pasting the same comment everywhere.. don't y'all get tired..
As per Zee News 405 for seats for BJP in UP. Total constituency is 403. Two seats given by Zee News on free of cost.
Irony is your display picture at one end you are happy seeing some one innocent dying and at other end you are praying to not kill an innocent

They r getting benefits as those areas r not getting used that's why's , start ing roads will make them weak ,
So they fired across the border then went in to mutilate the corpses . Sorry I don't buy this at all.
Yes sir. That, of course will happen. When cow become President, PM, CM, MP, MLA and human loiter on road foraging for food, dying after swallowing plastic.
True, any good work is opposed by group of vested interest.In fact our political parties often support such elements in search of vote banks. Aggressive media activism is also absent. Hi
True
.However, reservation is not poverty alleviation scheme, it is there for only those social groups, historically who has been exploited, marginalized, rendered weaker. Muslims wanted window within OBCs, Supreme Court says, you can create subwindow within OBCs, without breaching 50% barrier, but not on the basis of religion.
I am for freedom of speech but against the lampooning freedom of speech of another young person!
He  should be payed by police who kept the money with them. Or as promised RBI
Mouni baba open mouth
Anna, unfortunately, has lost all credibility. He has conveniently forgotten the Lokpal bill.  He is saffron under the skin. Kejriwal on the other hand transformed the face of Indian politics. The major parties have quietly adopted everything he stood for.
1). Rule says that loudspeakers should not be used between 10pm and 6am.  2)""If Muslims have the right to give azaan, non-Muslims have the right to sleep peacefully."" High court verdict

Congratulations Bmp & Modiji, Please do something to develop India, Except good speeches
Obviously haven't read about turning the other cheek. Funny kind of Christian fellow.
Modi ji's elevation too was so ominous that some sickulars and antidemocratic individuals declared that they would leave the country if he becomes PM! Same black forces are now chanting the same mantras oblivious of the fact that this is 21st century and people can differentiate between chalk and cheese!

Bhai this is not mainstream. Even Mira Rajput said third wave feminism is destructive.  And yes, mainstream feminists are indeed bullies. They keep on rioting and creating ruckus. They hate free speech, they conceal facts, they project lies etc (I have evidence for all of it. So please counter my perspective and not my facts)
These were happening 24√ó7. But the administration was always in sleeping mode.
She has been so priveleged all her life. But we have to work to meet our ends. We don't get to make our choices.
Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

4 people died and Indian express finds humour in it..rip journalism..
Modi banded 500-1000 notes. So his next step should be to band congress party
What does the word cost mean? Does it take foreign debt into consideration? Does it consider human wealth?
Mr. Narang it's just the matter of time, I am not stupid enough to believe that govts works for the betterment of masses.. you need to read thoroughly The Prince by Niccolo or the Republic by Plato. I am sure once this govt complete it's term in the office we will have bigger scams to quote... And that's what Dr. Manmohan Singh is talking about...
For what reason?ifu
Nothing new on it. Indians only gossip, take action instead of spreading failures
Sehwag your comments made  no  sense  at all.   You should  not have made the stupid comparison.  There is a big difference cricketer  and a martyr .
I bought One Plus 2 just about two months ago..2 days back I dropped it and got the entire screen cracked. Though it is working fine. But I am not able to repair it due to unavailability of service centre in Jammu & Kashmir... It's frustrating

We have enough support already . Turkey isn't our ally more like a traitor & have come to solve Kashmir issue lol
Perfect example of ""Vridha asharam- when people can just see and repeat words which they have heard in early morning "" Indian media is using AANA JI to take only wrong or negative  comments either it's for BJP or AAP .... but would say POOR PERFORMANCE
Do you have any doubt? Why was he holding some many pistols and ammunition etc ?If he is not when police rounded up why was he holding up and firing at police?
Bt massive win? Seriously?
Mr. Macchiwala I have spoken to Muslims in Gujrat and they were thankful to him because he saved their lives. I don't know where do you get this idea that Modi is responsible for riots.

Why he is scolding her who gives right to MLA to shout like this on SP of city....she was only doing her duty according to law...if there is something legal according to law then it's police duty to stop that ""dharna"" police don't work according to public sentiment it work only according to law. If this MLA is really worried about liquor then why ruling party is not putting ban on liquor?

Attention: Indians have launched a False Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏è Operations .   They claimed that Pakistani forces infiltrated the LOC killed and mutilated bodies of two BSF jawans .   The claimed location is not just heavily mined and fenced but has been under constant Indian Army surveillance citing attempted infiltration by Kashmiri Militants .   It's obviously an attempt to sway the international community away from the atrocities committed by Indian Occupation Forces on Unarmed Kashmiris.  Previously the Drama was done to fool Indian population for UP Election this time God know what they have in Mind but it's simply Evil and in the end people of India will suffer one way or the other

Everything was fine till she mentioned the new wave of feminism as destructive and then said ""why would I want to spend just an hour with Misha and then rush off to work? Why did I have her? She's not a puppy."" SO WRONG. That's almost as if saying that mothers who work and take care of their children treat their kids like puppies and have not gone through the same difficult times she might have gone through. Tsk. She sure should have chosen her words more wisely than that. This is too crude for a new age mother.
When an elephant like Modi walks and talks, he does not bother about street dogs barking at him.
Wolf in Sheep's clothing.  Keeps threatening to go on a strike against the Center for not implementing Lokpal but has not sat on  a dharna for a single day. Hypocrite. His dreams of BJP coming to power in Delhi and Punjab have been shattered by Kejriwal.

A crowd , mostly of women were protesting against opening of a liquor shop in residential locality. From social point of view protest was ok But what the Police was supposed to do? Stand there and allow deterioration of situation ? Or dispers the crowd and open the road for traffic. The legality of opening of the liquor shop lies under drugs and liquor dept. They must have called the police. The IPS was working under what is permitted by law.  Humiliating the officer, lady or any is to be condemned.

If the RBI did have enough new notes, but did not distribute then it defenitely will be intentional. All new notes issued before 31st dealine would have helped the hoarders to exchange the old for new. If RBI indeed is sitting on a huge supply of new 500s  they can be quickly distributed from jan 1 and Modi would have salvaged the situation to a large extent.

What should every Indian know about IIT? 1.You and I pay taxes. 2.Using that tax, government provides subsidy to IIT students. 3.IIT students fly to USA and most of them work and settle there. In short, Our taxes are used to contribute brightest of the brains to USA. PS: Some may argue by quoting examples of Narayanamurthy, Kejriwal, etc. But understand that those are just a handful of them. The majority of them do not contribute anything for the country that provided them education in IITs. Source: Quora

Yoginomics For a moment I was stunned; Maybe like many of his passionate supporters. Why would  BJP commit  a harakiri,antagonize minority ,provide a handle for a section of media and opposition to  mount an attack  with renewed vigour and glee( I told u so!) Will it damage its reputation and put a question mark on its developmental agenda?   But knowing Modi & Amit  Shah,their ability to think far ahead of the rest,I think they have a game plan with far reaching consequence which will pay them rich dividend in the electoral battles down the line.   Suppose they ensure for the next 2 years a splendid  model of governance   with high growth and  peace  coupled with impartial administration they bury the ghost and tag of 'communal' neutralize and silence the critics once for ever !  If the epitome of  right wing  'monster ' can make this paradigm shift then they will succeed in wooing.the minorities into their fold,which hitherto they have  not been able to.   More media  harks upon the negatives more support BJP will get as credibility  of media is at a new low thanks to vibrant social media.

Demonetization is OK but who's going to look after the sufferings of poor and aam aadmi ?
Sanghi Mahatma has done nothing but successfully dent UPA image , he has not a word to say against current govt not implementing Lokpal or any other issues but gunning after AK because he left his farcical Sanghi satyagraha to actually go political and do something for people , remember how all political parties were after AK saying that it's easy to shout from outside if you want to make a difference join politics and when he did all started gunning for him

Dont care about papu n party... carry on sir ji
Google pixel vs one plus 3t  Oops nowhere to compare  Its a completely different story
What an intelligently written and unbiased, objective article. NOT. TLDR - Pay the charges  because banks are answerable to shareholders for declining profits and they lend more money if they profit more. Also the opposition of  these charges by the government  ""would have a demoralising effect on banks who supported the government‚Äôs demonetisation move and had to handle the resultant mess."" [ Banks did their job once in a blue moon basically]. So if a bank is mismanaged and can't generate enough revenue through lending, it's depositor responsibility to bridge the gap.
This time new spark system they gonna implement i guess thats why they are taking time

If you haven't seen an educated beast yet you may see Somu Nigam. He is upset with Azaan for two minute but not upset with morning Bhajan for an hour crying by loud speaker all over India. Non of Hindu has complained about Azaan yet while Azaan has been singing in India for thousand of years ago. If Azaan would have been sung at night then it would be wrong but it has been singing in morning time means beginning of day time.    This type of person called an educated beast. He may be literate and hateful person but never be an educated and peaceful. He is Hindu terrorist supporter.
#BJP #Congress are several decades old parties and naturally had a huge fund and resources accumulated... unlike #AAP which is kid party and starting jumping by any way illegal or immoral... but forget that they forgot their basic principal of their existence and stood so low that their god father #Anna started criticising...

http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/    Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

He has right to make complain about anything, that's true it's noise or sound pollution so far. Some of you are written that giving them respect without making complain. In Europe, they won't creat sound from religious institutions. It does mean also they respect each of them. Moreover it depends how civilized you are the way you living your life more than religion. Religion doesn't make you great human if you are not yourself . You must hear song or music and it doesn't bother you rarely Azan does. I would say, from all religious institutions right now to stop making noise or pollution, not particularly Azan. Pray for your God deeply without bothering or annoying someone. Over thousand year religion brings war more than peace remember dumb religious.

Cashless is best decision result will be seen after total cashless Govt servant will suffer while demanding bribe
Wow. If this happen i too will have my own soon.
I won't support this sudden change why they need to do sudden change
Bring down prices... govt.need to assess valuation of these properties...a 700sqft flat cannot be costing 80lakhs +.. consumers are shelling out lifetime savings on pig stys
My son this is not 1971 and a brigade of our army is not combatting with the cowards of a whole country...  Its basically party time...  Punjab,  Nagaland, Assam and Kashmir will be separated

Despite fare increases, Dynamic pricing !
The high handedness of such politicians speaks of their character . The person who can create a scene for not getting Executive class seat can commit any crime if allowed to travel in general class in train .They are not fit for representing Indian people who are poor in general .
We shud salute this brave n nationalist man.it is a lesson to all.Communalists shud refrain to paint the Indian Muslims in bad colour.

Demonetisation has made all depositors to stand in long queues,begging banks to draw cash from their own accounts.This is the reality. But, 4.7 crores of new 2000/= notes was caught red-handed from an  individual in Bangalore. Does it not show the total failure of  the conditions, imposed by RBI &govt.?
RSS always supported British that is why they follow divide and rule now. Gandhiji assassination is it justified?
People needs some incubment  from younger  generation instead old ornamental spineless to  the coveted post.modi should show some body miracle  rather old practice.
Mr Shirish Kunder you may not know, but we made a man PM in 2014 with even better credibility than Aditya Nath and he has been behaving since then, at least he didn't participate in any riots. So, we have taken the similar chance here as well. Also, your suggestion all makes sense, making Dawood CBI chief, make him behave as well :V
Koi nai soch reha h apeny desh ki sab neta apny kud he ki soch reh WA modi ji
Hopefully the people will realise the betrayal perpetrated on them. The state of Tamil Naadu is now ruled by a bunch of money grabbers whose head honcho is in jail for the offense of ill begotten wealth. Poverty has not been addressed. Is a TV and mixee adequate comprise for a vote? Time to reject these politicians and move to a new future. POLITICIANS NEVER GUARANTEE OUR FUTURE, ONLY THEIR OWN.
BJP has won 82 seats not 80
And your manifesto says you will abolish income tax . So what's the point
Hazare is a stooge of RSS
Today i went to a pathologist  for blood test I asked him for digital payment first that doctor Denied for e payment i said him now a days a hawker is also accepting the digital payment.

@ Abhay Singh Have you heard about phoenix bird rising from the ashes...? GOOD LUCK MAN...üôÇ FROM KERALA - A PROUD COMRADE
People who speak against India amd support minorities talking against Hindus are seculars and people like modi who wants to see all as one irrespective of caste,creed,religions are non seculars.What a pathetic situation.
After this kejriwal is goinh to resign and have a fair elections. Because EVM is faulty and he won his election because of faulty EVM. Andolan karo kejriwal. We are with you.
If Manoj Tiwari did it intentionally then he is learning from kejri how to win Delhi elections üòÇ
Clearly not read history,only some distorted form of it serving a particular section. I wonder whether the real struggle of Indian Independence would remain intact for coming generation to know what inspired it. India turning into a reluctant democracy with a rider
Reservation is like another form of terrorism
Belated valentine rose to the guy he slapped with his slipper.
There is no need to give a statement after doing such a bit of work. You know what kind of person you are. You can not even find a place in hell.
Why Indian express keeping silence on bjp incredible win?
We are still paying for the mistakes of Gandhiji and Nehru,the same very day Pakistan proclaimed to be a Muslim nation,we should have declared ourselves as a Hindu nation.

Girish Rajani according to the population survey you people are 80% & we are 14% till 2080 we will be minorities.
Ok what about the current situation do not dig the past do something to improve the current.
I don't understand why ppl are congratulating Kangana! If complaining and being rude is considered brave and outspoken then there is something wrong! It's KJOs choice to decide who he wants in his movies! He probably doesn't want to cast her for this very reason of she playing the victim card endlessly and blaming everybody!
Certainly it is directed to all religions... Curb noise pollution
Even you should be ashamed of ur mentality for blaming a any person by seeing his ancestors...
lets face it,its an age of hype and fake with ABSOLUTE ZERO INVENTION..FORGET INNOVATION...
But I don't think Modi, Amit Shah and  Jaitly  team will allow her  to be a minister for a long time.  Now that Advani and Joshi are more or less out from the candidature from President election due to ayodhya case she may be given a chance as an eye wash
Hazare shaab..Now your party is ruling and u can't find Corruption ...???? you may get up 2019 for next protest.. until you can continue your sleep
It's better to leave this fellow to seat in BJP's chair if he is allowed. Now even Bhakts are not interested.
Pak seems to deliberately invite Indian Army for a surgical strike to trap our SF . The recent incessant provocation is part of a preplanned trap, to let down us globally. Indian Army Chief must be cautious to undertake yet another  surgical strikes. Strikes r must ...but execute the way beyond their expectations..Of course we can.....
Competition for royal Enfield, OMG ha hahaha, who cares, both the companies are losers, bajaj can't even manufacture their own engines

This PM doesn't give respect to house n democracy finally people . Hitler style n India will std.
This is not the destination, it's a journey & many jokers would have to be left behind to keep the sanity of governance. People who cry foul are either affected or have despicable ideas.
https://www.facebook.com/Vibrant.News.Hyderabad/videos/vb.782624795112634/1458550857520021/?type=2&theater  May I suggest you to Please read this report , If by ""appeasement"" you mean appeasement to mulism's. Who are the most backward section in this country.Muslim's. Reason's you ask? Communal prejudice, Ghettoisation ,Repeated Persecution.etc  Just for your information Muslim's are even more backward than Dalits,SC's,ST's even Non-Hindu SC/ST(Tribal's).In fact the backward,poorest and ghettoised community in India are Muslim's. When issues of these communities are bought in parliament no one objects.Ex Jat's,Patel,Tamil,SC's,Dalit,zoroastrian,Sikh , but if you talk about the conditions of Indian citizens who happen to be Muslim then its appeasement who constitute 14.2% of India's population.
Opposition is opposing coz they are sitting there to oppose whether it is right or wrong. They have shut their eyes & Mind.
Uncle your religion came into existence just 2000 years ago our is here for last 10 thousand years if we had hatred we wouldn't have existed this long

http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/  Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake
Fake gdp
Amitj Aggar Dear Sir, this is a matter of choice as suggested by you to avoid mistaken identity. Pl let people apply your formula and than see the result.

Come on bajaj. There's a bike to launch. Cut the trash
I like this act. But what i dont like is, the new money is again going to wrong pockets. We are struggling to get one 2000 rs note after standing in a huge line for hours. But all the  big shots are getting money to their homes directly from the bank. what the hell is really going with the RBI and banks.
@Sanjiv At least be original. How much do you get paid to just sit down and copy paste comments? So sad! ü§£

A Question of Order India, Turkey, and the Return of Strongmen  What happens when a democratically elected leader evolves into an authoritarian ruler, limiting press freedom, civil liberties and religious and ethnic tolerance?  India and Turkey are two of the world‚Äôs biggest democracies‚Äîmulti-ethnic nations that rose from their imperial past to be founded on the values of modernity. They have fair elections, open markets, and freedom of religion.  Yet this is an account of how the charismatic strongmen Narendra Modi, in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, in Turkey, used the power they had won as elected heads of state to push their countries toward authoritarian ways.
Serious issue thanks to shewag responded immediately. Politics entered in education system. It is serious thing. Nobody condemning for their own interests. Future of Indian youngest generation will be dark due to poison thinking. Is these are ache din.
Jagran also a very much noisy
Navaratri and ganesh chaturthy dont gappen 5 times i a day dear.
Does the cow protection movement also include murdering people Mrs. Nirmala sitaraman? Or is it the government's job to punish accusers? R we still fighting the freedom struggle? Or are we  today citizens of an independent democracy better known as india? Worship the cow dont kill it its holy and we consider her as our mother. But we also love and respect our fellow Indians they r our brothers and we expect justice for our brother(pehlu khan, a dairy farmer) and his family for this brutal murder is broad day light. So I urge the government to condemn this act and to ensure justice is given to those who deserve it before Indians of free and independent india lose faith in their democracy and its justice system. Humble request as a citizen belonging to the majoritarian group
Sycophancy is the order of the day
You are right sir... Derivates i feel is like gambling...

In ground reality rabbi has created lots of prob due to pricing issue
I strongly appose forced religiousness either Muslims or Hindu.
It's not hatred, just asking why did Hindus had to leave Kashmir. Sonu has just said that there should not be forced religion, in every locality Azaan is there on the loud speakers & very few temples play loudspeakers. In maximum no. Love Marriages, Only Hindu boy or girl have to change their religion & convert into Muslim.
There was no fatwa and it has been confirmed... People are being misled by media... Only NDTV had the guts to apologize for this and clarify that it was only an appeal.
Well safe to say that not many women marry at 21 and have a baby soon thereafter.  And have the income to stay home with them. But good for her though she shouldn't knock down other people like she seems to do in this article.

Why not..go for it.. Let there also be rule that when bank ATM is out of CSH or not in service, bank pays the customer in return the same transaction amount. Secondly if customer goes to Bank and if there server is down, let banks pay 8% interest for month than regular 4% for that month. Seems like a win win for both banks and customers.

Dear India will u again label today's valley wide protests as paid and ignited by Pakistan via Social media. Will u again label all the students having received 500 or 1000 INR to protest today on the stake of their career. Come on grow up talk it's too late. The situation is worth attention catching.
Sonu Nigam started his career singing at Jagarans.....did he ever care how many people had to go sleepless nights because he was singing bhajans all night........Now that Azaan has suddenly brought enlightenment upon him.....He should also speak against use of loudspeakers at Mandirs, Gurudwara, concerts.....they all create disturbance....
If still bjp want to be in government should take strong action against Natalie.
Completely wrong,  ATM out of cash is the ground reality.....you pleople are lieing all around

Truely very sad such a young life to be taken away so soon.
Some comments are criticizing Anna instead of Kejriwal.  What a mentality.
Work of a news paper is to provide information not to judge anybody on their own and then make people accept that judgement. But sadly all newspapers and TV news channels in India behaves like supreme court . They will have their own judgement on every topic.
Shayad se yeh 2 channels opposition se managed nai hue to usse BJP managed bata diya....

I respect mira, her choices, homemakers a lot but she shouldn't insult working women who continue jobs after marriage and kids. Every mother loves her kids, everyone's situation,dreams,conditions, methods are different. Crores of middleclass wo.en work by choice,some by situation,they dont think they are dog mothers,their kids will punch if someone insulted their mothers hard work by this way. These days Kids are independent,tough so does mothers . Everyone has right to make their career,follow dreams,goals,passions, families these days help working women in chores and childcare.

Do you give equal rights to Hindus? what percent Hindus are left in your country since 1947?
Asrar, I said all religions. See I have problems with anyone using loudspeakers be it temple or mosque. Be it azan aur Navratri. 2 wrongs don't make a right. If anyone want to pray, he/she can very well go into his or her religious premise. If he or she wants to pray at home, use technology. I have problems with 5 minutes azan and 5 days of Hindu festival loudspeakers.

Basically Neerat, choices should be respected, whatever they are. No one is lesser be it a homemaker or a woman who manages both work and home.  Her saying, ""Misha isn't a puppy and I won't leave her alone"" portrays working women as having fun when they step out of their homes.  Besides these days everyone has a problem with everything. :D

Your army and the Govt wanted to make a show of it. They got at ICJ. It is strange that in a so called democratic country Army courts are permitted to operate. It was objected by many opposition parties like PPP and PTI but given extension for another 2 yrs.Civil courts are scared to  pass judgement. What a country where judiciary is scared.
Batkha dutt and ndtv must be sad
very simple question.where were indin army that time.i need answer with logic.
Mr. PM your speech was all about digitization and none on demonetization. Dont you think you should address a press conference or parliament in which case you will be questioned. And you clearly dont have the courage to do that.
Which is a bigger joke that woman singing or the bike

well GVA/GDP new formula have revised the base year and included wholesome production data in projection of industry and service instead on relying on cso/iip.Those who doubt the GDP actually in their blind hate for modi doubting themselves as their father/mothers.Too bad self hating syndrome is on rise .
My last and final appeal to PM Sh. Modi Ji, let the war begin and get this over. daily we are facing such coward behavior from Pakistan. The same treatment required in Kashmir also, if any politician favor terror activity shoot them also declaring Terrorist. This should be over by now can't be tolerated any more. We all Indians are with you.
man u  did noting so why i salute u
I already said that üòú. And I would love it.
Yes - it's a cash based economy so the steps demontization will affect the GDP and future growth. The poor will suffer. Want to chase the black money - go to the Swiss bank

The way some journalists go out of the way to argue for and support Afzal Guru and his supporters, I wish it is much better if they openly support Rahul Gandhi and Congress than this
When Akrabuddin Owaisi publicly said that he could kill all Hindus in a span  of ten minutes time there was not much outrage. Now why is  so much outrage against Sonu Nigam who said that he is not a Muslim and doesn't want to get disturbed by the noise of loud speakers ?
From beginning to end he  has told that, people are not fool man better u understand and Muslims are very sensitive about religious beliefs so he thought nicely catch up Muslim votes, mr pinarai first u see people of Keralas waiting for there ration and irrigation supply now what about saumya murder case?? And jisha murder case now actress also not safety in ur state pulser suni was about surrender and he was ready to tell all truth in front of court but ur Singam cops caught him in front of court itself now u r telling now no one can discuss regarding actress matter and this is my order and pulser suni is a my culprit over,  every one knows who is behind this quotation team ur minister level and ur party active members also, mr pinarai what u think about yourself u r North Korean president brother or what???
You ppl now feel everything odd by Muslims... let's separate all the Muslims to a particular state n feel tension n noise free...wt u say Mr S nigam.
I don't look at this as a battle: Infosys Chairman

Rome was not built in a day.. And here we are talking of India, the biggest democracy of the world, one man has stood up to make the change he wants to see in the country. What has not been done in the last 65yrs he is doing in a methodical check to clean India. Be a citizen of India and stop the insult of your motherland. STOP BEING A INFLUENCE OF STUPID POLITICS OF THE STUPID INDIAN POLITICAL PARTIES. BE THE CITIZEN OF INDIA, NOT THE RELIGION OR PARTY POLITICS. This is for citizens with brains.

I salute every working woman who spend quality time with kids and excel at workplace too. Being a homemaker is her choice. That's it. I'm skeptical how magnanimous she may be to accept her husband's choice if he intends  to be a homemaker.   Men also have equal rights to be at home or work. Most of the parents look for a groom who earns fat-some so that the woman gets the privilege to stay home.  Nobody is born to work. Irrespective of the gender, if one wants to take a backseat in their career, it's the other one's responsibility to take lead. Being a homemaker is one's choice and that privilege can be taken by both man and woman.
Modi ji please put RTI in political parties so that they can disclose the donations RECVD from were

Dear congress and left there should be some thing wrong with your politics or with your policy of appeasement of minority's and making the majority un happy ,   Like providing benefits to widows of some religions   I do support the fact the eligible under privileged should be supported with out considering his / her cast or religion but simply based on their  eligibility or circumstances .   Or else the part who act or actually does and propagate upliftment of every one as a nation will be winning

Speechs wont work if ill thoughts still around you.... Political parties are exempted under income tax law to deposit old currency notes in their bank accounts....
How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly ""legal"" steps? Answer:- -> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party] -> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people. [According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.] -> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account. [No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax] -> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white. [Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money] ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!! *Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process teach you about how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.  Isn't it fascinating?
Tamil nadu has not voted to bjp,  hence modi has decided  not to put one governor  who is been visiting guest how he will understand the people expectation , every body punishing the common man
Modi or yogi. He is terrorist attacked 3 talaq. Cow mother. He doing religion politics.
Sonu is right....
Modi se sirf nenda he Kar saktey hai Aur kuch nahi pher Bhi I proud I am Indian wah is leya ki hamarey desh key jawan border pe lad Rahey hai Aur cow rakshak desh me lad Rahey hai
So from now on. SADHUS and Sanyasis abandoned their Tapasya in jungle and mountains. They are now either politicians or businessmen. Thousands of young persons gave their lives never look after the positions after independence. But now those are supposed to uplift the characters of general public they themselves hankered after position and money.
D Raja has written it. We can ignore the article
Let BJP come forward n disclose source of all donations received from crony capitalists
Now Banks r trying to focus on such illegal income, which is risk free. Customer now must make the cash counters of Banks crowdy. FM of India is busy in manipulating the records to prove demonization as success.

Awareness required for the  ground level businessman, state level ministry to be strict for baning cash transaction. A businessman is earning 30 - 40% of profit for the goods today, Modi ji please form a policy to control market price. A pan shopkeeper  is earning much more than an engineer today.
To some extent he is right....but it's applicable to all religion not only Azaan.

I support the statement. Its doesn't have to be religious every time. I even hate when during durga pujas people put loudspeakers. I remember the time when I had class 12th board exams and one speaker was just beside my room. I used to curse them a lot. People do not speak when a Muslim or a Hindu is dying of hunger or poverty but will now all gang up against sonu nigam. God bless humanity.
Ok Mr. Digviajy fine lets write what we want to talk on bullets and fire them on Pakistan...

Amazing isn't it? That liberals today use the fascism because they parrot it. If they knew what Fascism really was, larger and larger government that oversaw private business and regulated it and taxed it to death, maybe they wouldn't be so fast to use because of how that description is so eerily close to how democrats govern. What else is a fascist trait? Going after churches and places of worship? Putting limits on what people can say, even in the privacy of their own homes? Widespread domestic spying? All things done by the Obama administration and yet none of them would think to use the word fascist to describe those 8 years. Then again, until Trump came along, most of them didn't know what the word meant until it became part of the script. ""How to whine on social media in 3 easy steps""
why are they crying on stage?? coz of launching getting delayed?
the effect to economy is reflected by the markets first, see how the markets have fallen from past 10 days, and how GDP forecast is being cut down, its an clear indicator that the decision taken is goin to cost a lot in terms of future growth and the INR is getting weaker day by day at some point of time will vertically spike inflation
Being a Hindu I say you must have asked that person to lower his bhajan volume as someday he or his family members may also fall sick

http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/    Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
Appreciate Good work and Question all the wrongs. But, keep up to the topic instead of abusing for no reason.  Thanks

Dear Narendra Modi ji, the Activists, MSM, NGOs & Leftist didn't vote for you never will. We voted for you. Screw their opinion. Do the needful, mercilessly.
Congress required to accept that lower,medium and common peoples had left faith on them due to their ill planning .They have to accept that there is no leader who can come forward  to take challenge to re-strengthen the party and come atpar with Sh.Narinder Modi &Amit shah BJP Party.
Congress is a bunch of jokers and biggest clown rahul

Bro you studying law that's good. But calling a terrorist a terrorist doesn't require study of law.
Certainly not a good move by BJP. He don't have any vision except giving non sense statement.
Ganpati visarjan happens once in a year,in same way they have tajiya juloos. Problem is Azaan happens everyday. We live fast life where ppl want peace at first place after working all day. If someone wants to listen to peaceful tune of it than better he/she should listen it in the house without disturbing others' peace.

sanjay bro...ur logic is right..In a country like India where many religion ppl  living togeather have the right to perform their religion it may disturb others..But we dont have to misuse those and use it in a right manner....azaan call  apprx 2 min call is ok but using loud speaker than permitted is not a right thing..same way we can notice  others using loud speaker for their festivals,prayers through out the day which will disturb  kids,aged,patients.and also the environment ...but many are not batting an eye on those issues...

No parent wants to be labelled as the father of a terrorist. My appeal to each and every citizen is that please dont criticize or hold this family responsible. Looking at what the young generation is today influenced by it is not the fault of the parents but these youngsters themselves as they believe in Jehad, Freedom from everything and they have this strong conviction that they are right and everyone else is wrong. They unfortunately dont have the patience to demonstrate against the system peacefully. Guns never solved any problems. Guns will lead you to your grave sooner or later.

No Rafi RSS never supported British . Just think what Islam is all about , it is about Islam and Islammyat , everything else is fly in the milk so as to speak . RSS in a Hindu majority nation is about Hindu , Hinduism and Hindustan .  About Gandhi assassination , yes it was justified considering the time it occurred. The nation is partition on both sides and massacred Hindus are arriving from the East and Wast . When Hindus and Sikhs retaliated , Gandhi went on his usual fast unto death . Did that stop Muslim mayhem ?

Opposition members in d parliament do not have democratic spirit, i wonder why they dont allow others speak.

Democratic spirit n behaviour is expected of them, otherwise, what what d student community will learn from them.

http://indianexpress.com/.../fatwa-issued-against.../  Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake
Modiji u should remove it totally n look no BJP person is not exempted if his guilty

Every political parties sheltering criminals and BJP is not an exception. Since BJP is in power, they know only taking action against opponents, and don't think any other party in power would have taken the revenge like BJP.
Congress ruled 70 years by dividing the nation and national leaders amongst themselves.

//KCR has marketed his Bill to hike reservations as a move based on economic criteria claiming that it has nothing to do with religion or caste// KCR has to understand, reservation is not poverty alleviation scheme, it is there for only those social groups, historically who has been exploited, marginalized, rendered weaker. Muslims wanted window within OBCs, Supreme Court says, you can create subwindow within OBCs, without breaching 50% barrier, but not on the basis of religion.

>> Kulgam attack: Bank employees were killed by CRPF men, Hizb || Militant outfit Hizbul Mujhadeen has claimed the responsibility of deadly Kulgam attack in which 5 police men and 2 bank employees were killed. Burhanuddin, Operational Spokesperson Hizbul Mujhadeen told news agency that militants didn‚Äôt kill the two bank employees but they were shot dead by CRPF personnel who were accompanying them. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt attack the vehicle with intent to loot the cash. We have enough cash. We condemn the killing of two bank employees and want to clarify that they were shot dead by CRPF personnel and not by militants,‚Äù Burhanuddin said adding that militants can never target innocent Kashmiris.

Rose Kƒ±lƒ±n√ß I know dear. I agree with that I always say to reduce decibel point of loud speakers. When there are more mosques then 1-2 of them should only use loud speaker. But I hate the way he showed his hypocrisy. He has been my fav singer from a long time but the way he targeted us only and said others don't do anything like this is the thing I am against of.

Same guy shamed UDF when aadhar was launched... Everything is approximate which anyone can estimate to be any limit..proven data talks and not numbers on speeches.. Income tax is still squeezed from middle class..prices of fuel and other essential commodity is high only
Though the IITians and other talented people leave our country to get to do what they want, their base (family) is in India. Hence in spite of spending a part of income they earn, they save and remit it to India. Such remittances serve a great purpose of balancing the current account deficit of our country. Hence though they aren't contributing directly at the beginning of their careers, they benefit their families and indirectly our country. Reverse brain drain is a phenomenon that is widespread today. A lot of these talented people left our country because they could not find the right environment in our country to nurture their interest or talent. Nowadays a lot of them return back with distinctions that are recognised throughout the world and are contributing by helping to set up the atmosphere so that in the future, our people need not go abroad.
Indian politics doesn't have enough courage . We can never beat Pakistan.
Where is the black money? Y r u not naming n shaming the ppl whose money was found now?

Sir ,With due respect i want to convey you that there are doubts in the trading community that by mere verbal assurances of not doing postmortems by concerned authorities will work! Pl see the example of corruption by black sheeps in banking sector in issuance of new notes!
Hizib claimed the responsibility but said bank employees shot dead by crpf... Bloody cowards
He is out of industry for a while no work, wants some public attention and issues like these are common these days to get back in action.
Better ask PM Modi because before becoming PM he was talking BIG things of destroying Pakistan & now why is he keeping quite.

Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù,  ‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù   ‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù  If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us  India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face. China Claim South China Sea  China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly  Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off  India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty  If China Can Do For Their Mother Land  Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do) Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician. Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.  http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/223497-1105737253588/IndusWatersTreaty1960.pdf

Very good move as it will reduce interest cost on goverment borrowing.Previous goverment in the past borrowed so much money in the past to meet expentiture .Central & State goverment used to present deficit budget. Goverment is doing its best to improve finances.This will help in containing inflation & more money for development.Banks should now reduce borrowing rates on home & personal loan, so demands  pick up resulting more employment

By using microphone and speakers are maybe disturbing sleep of people from other religions. As devout Muslims know their prayer timing, it is better to avoid using these speakers.

As Nithin Gadkari said; ""if criminals enter the party, we lessen their faults and increase their merits"". The act qualifies him to Share the stage with Yogi Adithyanath.

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
It appears that there is more indiscipline in the country. It is advisable to give good education to all so that they learn to be polite and good moral characters.
Work for law and order and nothing else and remove all illitrate politicians from the system
No bosses over there take fare actions . Employee who are onroles they treat the person working on 3rd party payrole as their servant

She didn't mean the other babies are. Cmon. She was just referring to her own baby. And since it's her first child it's very obvious she's still learning to be a mother.
See the stupidity of indian PM who is worried about summer instead of country   In the 31st edition of 'Mann Ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on a number of topics and issues including VIP culture in our country, bridging the gap between rich and poor, and also encouraging students to try new things during their summer vacations. However, one piece of advice that has really touched a chord with people on social media is PM Modi's suggestion on putting out water for birds and animals this summer. With temperatures soaring across the country, PM Modi suggested children take up this initiative as it will not only help the creatures but also instill empathy in children.
Let me see....How many MUSLIM men stand up for this Poor Lady ??
Omer Majeed why u abuse krishna ? krishna created prophets like muhmmad and u abused him ?
In a country where Maa Durga is worshipped as the Universal Mother, a bunch of hooligans in a University, celebrate the demon whom she killed as a martyr and say she was a sex worker who seduced him and killed him after honeymooning with him. That is allowed as free speech by Congress and Left who went to defend those in the University. And now when a woman Minister reads that out as to what was happening in the University from the University authenticated documents, because evidence was asked, she was not being allowed to speak and interrupted with yelling and shouting and now they demand an apology from her, wait and take a deep breath, for blasphemy! This, my friends, is the hypocrisy of Congress and Left who support free speech, and this my friends, is the hypocrisy of the pseudo-liberals and pseudo-feminists in this country, who would allow a real abuse of Mother and Mother land in a University in the name of free speech, but will not defend a woman who happens to be a Minister of a party that does not follow their ideology. Such tolerance, much hypocrisy!
Yeah and their semi auto pilot system will break down. Hehe... Indians don't obey traffic rules. I don't know how that's gonna play out. Big Test for Tesla. ;)

Excellent! So what's his plan ? Relocating to Sukma or be Kanhaiya's, Shehla's, Omar's prof in JNU or relocating to Pakistan ? We have to know. National security is very important
These calculations are waste of time, the ultimate winner will be AAP with a thumping majority.

I guess Rahul Gandhi or Mamta Banerjee would make India strong again....but again really they can?????
ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY for CHINA'S NEED OF SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM  =======================================  Arunachal Pradesh of india, the land of rising sun, undisputed beauty queen of Nature & powerhouse of hydropowers is always been a bone of contention between India & China.  But why china is so adament to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet ? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-politics or Militaristics or Expansionist mindset of China ? Why China is playing a zero-sum game knowing fully well that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh  at any cost ?   It is undoubtedly clear to everybody that the CORE GROWTH ENGINE of china's economy has been SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM which has two componants as LOCAL & GLOBAL features.   It is the GLOBAL FEATURE which makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via NAGALAND as GATEWAY for china to the SHORTEST riparian transportation system based upon RIVER KALADIN of MYANMAR to the BAY of BENGAL (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar which will eventually form KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor powered by 'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH EAST of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as current global riparian transportation system takes too much times & distances to cover. That is why CHINA keeps disputing the ARUNACHAL PRADESH thereby giving much irritation to the India and preventing both powerhouses to realise full mutual prosperities.  But this ZERO-SUM game can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having RORO facility at DHUBURI & elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE , river brahmaputra can provide peaceful & sustainable riparian solution to above discussed problem and for this both India & China Government have to build following multilateral economic corridor powered by inland, road & rail networks (taking both Bangladesh & Bhutan Government on-board) , namely , ""DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING (DDTLB) ECONOMIC CORRIDOR "".

Each statement minister should speak to RBI, get daily allocation for new money, ensure that the money reaches the poor and far flung areas. The bank manager / branches should disperse money to the poor in villages and the owners of the tea garden estate (e.g.) they should speak to CM, get allocation of new money from STATE govt (RBI) and disperse money to poor people.  Also the state government should provide the food (rice and Atta) from govt warehouse against the AADhar card. Why and what is the ThinkTank doing???  They should help drive the cause of curbing black money and the new money being seized should be put into circulation  and allocated to bank so that ATM can dispense money. The new money caught till date is 50 Cr. this could be dispensed to more than 250,000 public if given Rs 2000 each
ohoo ?? Good
But still its poison.......
Stop all this as country prestige on test and enemy be taught lesson first at all costs and sacrifices.

Dear Islam is a holy faith and Quran is a holy book  But why all world is against Islam only.   Why so much population blast everywhere by Muslims only  Why whenever there is a terror activity in 9 out 10 cases there is a Islamic jehadi outfit  Why women are treated as children producing machine in islam  Why Muslims prefer madrsas education rather than modem scientific education   Why sunnis are killing there fellows who follow bit different faith  Why Muslims hate other faiths   If one needs blood. He won't match religion but check blood group
Why no chutiya liberal & sickular stands for the miseries of Kashmiri Pandits? Why no liberal bukchod returned their awards on their miseries? Why no one shouted slogans in JNU for killing & raping of Kashmiri Pandit women by islamic militants?

a specific group ( obviously politically biased) in India also , supported Trump's politics during election , even they prayed to God for his win. i hope , every concerned public is understanding my direction. may be they are supporting this killing too. because it comes from the same communal and racist mentality.

Venky - has to KMA Modi every now and thenn to keep his job as minister. He lost the 12014 election by a huge margin and then sneaked in through the back door - India is the only democracy in the world that allows defeated politicians to become ministers - utter disbgace when these fakes start sermonisung .
You are correct Trump is highly obliged by Indian Hindus who prayed hard for his victory. Muslim never prayed for his success. But I am truly telling you I prayed for Trump's success and even today I appreciate his Nationalism and wish him more success. I will be happy the day Trump kicks Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because they too are the same fundamentalist Muslims as that of the seven countries he banned.
Bollywood has been the fiefdom of select few and those who raise voice against are ostracised. It's good that some one has raised the issue.

By one stroke it can be reversed. Make it mandatory for all public servants ( leave the politicians) to admit their wards to govt school only. Next comes the next neighbourhood school for all independent of caste , creed, class and religions. In fact once the govt servants are compelled they will ensure the later.

Some of Mira's comments may stem from the judgement that full time mothers face today. Feminism is surely about choice. Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a ""puppy"". As long as all parties (including the mother) have a choice, then it's all good.
Dear friends..I am  Bangladeshi & I also  a Muslim, I always proud of my religion. Unfortunately shocked me the news thatt was unexpected from sonu ji!

And actually she has never had a career, so her perspective isn't of consequence yet ... her choices are her own but just because a successful actress like Kareena Kapoor works after having a baby and Mrs Shahid Kapoor doesn't it really is of no consequence ... work is not always just a necessity ... it is often a passion and this person obviously hasn't found it yet ... good luck to her :P
Only cow is safe! Oh what a government and religion!  I studied Hinduism for three months but these people are different.

Misbehavior of MLA's is nothing new. In the presence of Public they want to show their authority to gain popularity. The Police was acting  as per the law. To interfere is like diluting authority of law agencies. He could have discussed the issue with the lady officer instead of acting foolishly.

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
Who doesn't understand your thoughts they have brain tumour, they never understood
How by anti romeo squad? Or bashing by goons in the name of religion.

Thank you Delhi Police. Our West Bengal Police should treat Jadavpur University students the same way

Modi ji, Can you declare all Rs 500 and 1000 notes deposited  by political parties/temple trusts waqf boards to be zero value ???? This money is not the earning of political parties or trusts but donations. No person cal claim as thier own..  comnpare this with counterfeit money donated to political parties by cash ....can they clain it as legal tender? Demonetied notes are also not legal tender jusy because political parties are depositing it.  Can you answer in your nex Man Ki Baat.....
Two spokesperson will do the talking, two deputy CM to immediately take over if required, but danger lies with arrogance of spoke persons.
When Demonitisation takes place it means economic conditions are poor
It is nor a surprise. None of the Governments (Congress or BJP) ever bothered about Aam Aadmi and this was the first time that AAP brought Aam Aadmi in front on stage with full respect and both large National parties did not like this. Other parties always wanted people like Ambani and Adani in front of the stage.

I am in perfect agreement with Sonu Nigam. No nonsense now .we had enough during regime of ""votebank-loving"" parties and their appeasement techniques but no more nuisance now. Let's come out in open and raise our voices open ,loud and ,clear. Only mosques have been allowed that audio system ,and no other religion, so why not talk specific and shout collectively against it.
It's a simple logic guys, villagers or cow owners don't get benefit rearing cows until their natural death, so they had to sell to slaughter house for their benefit, or else left them outside of their own. Who is gonna take care of animals which if of no benefit, and population of cows eventually rises. Do some math guys, think also for those farmers, guys here talking with big mouth does not have those sense of hard work required to rear an animal
Some one is also talking along with Rahul Bajaj .,the person is in hurry to leave the launch
Lol, good observation Nitin and I agree with you but Azaan is actually 'given', not 'sung'.
Mohamed Pasha  Years (say before 100 years) loud speaker was not used before Azan. Why should it be used now ?
waiting for indian govt. to say kadi ninda for this act
The bike is specially hand crafted for people who work at night
Disagree all you want. Don't attack those you don't agree with. This shows your rant and intolerance.
He is right in my view.. prayers are made by heart no by loud speakers.. If honking is against law then miking should be toooo
Demonitization will b successful only wen we get rid of pollution.. Traffic.. Only wen we have good roads..transportation and infrastructure..real estate bubble shud burst...aftr payin so much tax..  A common man expects atleast this much..
Guarav K that is there internal matter Same like kashmir is internal matter to us and he didn't funded or supported Isis it is usa who has supported it and Russian president putin had many times given open statements regarding this issue.  For many muslims all around the world he is a good leader and it's up to you if you want to hate him then you have total rights to do that...  Few examples of his work...   What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government....

Sh.Arun Jaitely must be strict in financing Banks he should not infuse more tax payer's fund as we have already lost 1.14 lac Cr in NPA  ? instead he must give this money to 1) """"START UP"""" projects to be run by Engineers / doctors/ medical / student to be supervised by retired alumni / experts of the field.  2) He should not allow import of unnecessary material from china sticker, elect items etc. 3) stop import of Gold? when we have enough gold in India . 4) must reduce Interest rate charged to borrowers he must check Cost of Funds mechanism + 2 or 3% as management fees on Cost of funds not more than that. so it will be available @ 10 to 11%  5) Why PSU nationalized banks do not open Demat account with minimum charges? 6) he must finance Sea Water desalination plant  (UAE) to get water when there  is shortage of water ( no rain) and must be taken to drought hit areas. 7) instead of selling Old Railway compartments as scrap  they must send it  to remote areas to connect small small villages under  local  control administration. 8) make foolproof EVM machines with finger prints at the time of verification before vote and should match same time while voting.
Wtf
It's really hurting to hear such a nasty thing from you pointing an accusing finger at a particular community. ..Learn the lesson of religious tolerance  India being a secular country is hailed  by many foreign countries. ..such comments only add fuel to the fire..You should desist from commenting  in a partisan manner...

Is  this  English  version  of  desabhimani
Dr. Raghu Ram Rajan was defenitely an intellectual and genius. That is the reason he became Indias RBI governor. But when it comes to performance, I think, he could not deliver what India expected of him. He took charge as RBI givernor when India was on a take off line. But the governor failed to press the accelerator . I think he was rather keeping his feet on the brake.  All genius are negatively oriented.
Come on guys. He has a point and I agree with him. I am a Muslim and if I want to, I will go to the prayers even if there is no azaan. Why should others get disturbed by it? But yes, the same rule should be followed by everyone.
People who question his degree should know that he thinks far better than lots of highly educated folks who either keeps mum or scare poor citizens.
India's response should be simple attack a rangers camp and   mutilate 4 soldiers in return LOL. If you do not have the capability to do that just go and shave somebody instead
Rahul new guru is Arvind Kejriwal, god knows which is good joker ,  why they do not apply for Pakistan PM
Don't you proof read your stuff?? Stupid NDTV.. 56 Billion? Seriously???
Shanglu's report has exposed the real face of Kejri and working of AAP.  Naturally Anna is disappointed.
I think due to last year's episode
Open retaliation is must not commando surgical strike operation . Direct attack on Pakistan is must and kill 1-2 lac soldiers of Pakistan.

Morning aarti at daybreak is a practiced Hindu ritual in all temples just as azaan is in mosques.In every religion emphasis is laid on morning prayers to start the day by remembering God.with the growth of population both mosques and temples have to use loudspeakers to reach maximum number of people.In today's busy daily life people have to rise before daybreak to be able to get ready for office,school or for walk or exercise.for years there has been harmony and camaraderie but what has happened suddenly in the past three years that intolerance has become fashionable?

For ur kind information indias true nuclear potential will be achieved bcoz this man faught with everyone in this world formally and diplomatically to get india what it wanted and the entire world was shocked how india got the nuclear treaty signed. He waived off loans of the farmers who are the backbone of this economy not like the current pm.who waived off 7000 crores of just 63 people. There is a big gap when it comes to how an economist thinks for a nation and how a greedy politician thinks.

The biggest disservice to the nation by Anna Ji was promoting  Kuljiwal. For his mistake he must observe one day fast at Jantarmantar and seek pardon from Delhites
He talked against bhajan and kirtans from temple and Gurudwara too. But only if media reports whole story or people try to find out on their own, will u be able to take rational decisions. Btw what's with defeated soul? His soul is defeated, are u the judge in these matters? Taken precedence over God ?
http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/  Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake
Ask 100 people what their jio phone number.. not even 10 guys remember.. Jio is gonna close down the day it starts billing..
An appeal is bad when it is sex appeal

Cow in Hinduism:  Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism. Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù  Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù  Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù

Its a very good decision to demonitise 1000 & 500 ruoees notes, but why exempt the political parties when they deposit their money in bank. Why double standard with common man, isn't exempting the political parties is corrupting the original decision of demonitisation.

Rafi Ahmed, trust you are aware that Islam doesn't respect other religion's and existence of other gods. Muslims are not secular. This is a major reason for the jihadi violence and the untold mysery the world is suffering today.
If you know anybody who is screeching about Trump's ""islamaphobia"" or ""muslim ban"", perhaps they need to know a few things.  1. Sixteen muslim countries bar Israeli citizens from entering. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech ""Jew phobia"" or ""Jew ban""? I think not.  2. There are Israeli citizens who are muslim. Those muslim Israeli citizens are barred from entering 16 muslim countries. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech ""islamaphobia"" or ""muslim ban"" about those countries? Do they protest outside the embassies of those countries? I think not.  Perhaps anybody you encounter who accuses Trump of ""islamaphobia"" or a ""muslim ban"" should be made aware of those facts, mentioned above. Perhaps they should also be made aware that Trump's Executive Order is a temporary order and not permanent like that of the 16 other countries which have permanent bans.  Just for the further education of those who are being led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of those countries which bar Israeli citizens from entering:      Syria     Iran     Iraq     Yemen     Libya      Algeria     Bangladesh     Brunei     Kuwait     Lebanon     Malaysia     Oman     Pakistan     Sudan     Saudi Arabia     United Arab Emirates

Sir, illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and insecurity are some of the key issues we need to address on war footing. Unless these issues are not dealt with we cannot hope to see light at the end of tunnel.  Even after 7 decades we are still talking of unscientific form of reservations.  How stupid of our rogue politicians ? They still continue with same malpractice.  We need reservations based on economic backwardness and proper financial assitance with incentives ( like free education, food and material support, employment  etc). When this gap is reduced, things will start falling in line. This Cannot be achieved in a day . At least we can have hope.

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
Why spit venom against a leader who has won the heart of more than a hundred million people from Uttar Pradesh (total population of UP is said to be 220 million)? Is he being targetted for his bold statements or his safron outfit? Now who is being intolerant, the so-called seculars or their bait noire, BJP? Yogi ji has duly been elected to head the UP government. If anyone feels that his elevation to the covetted post is wrong, he is free to seek judicial remedy. Yogi ji is going to work, like his idol, Narendra Bhai Modi, for the betterment of UP as a whole. Moreover, the parliamentary elections of 2019 are not far away. If he doesn't perform, his party is bound to suffer at the hustings. His detractors should wait at least till then.

If you are a man of understanding, then only read this or you can ignore my comment. The lack of space for any political dialogue pushes people to take up gun. The likes of Yasin Malik had given up gun in 90's because they were promised a dialogue by India. Unfortunately India has a habit of breaking promises. From Nehru's Plebiscite promise to India's dialogue promise.

Sai Ram, Dont make such comments about IITs from what u read and hear online:  Research wise IITs are excelling like anything.Many of the professors came back from USA ,just to teach and do research in India.Funding to IITs also come from our alumini who have excelled in India and abroad.Many students go abroad for higher education and most come back.IITs collaborate with leading institutes like  DRDO,TIFR,etc and immensely contribute to technical development of nation.As a taxpayee your money invested in IITs  is definitely well spend. You should be more worried about how your taxes are spent  by corrupt politicians who get elected due to lack of good education among voters.

Marxism shows you the way out of human misery, though how you practice it depends on your own understanding. The rightist philosophies on the other hand hit a blind alley, just as religious preachers talk of very nice things while practising and endorsing the exact opposite. As regards,  Stalins and Pol Pots, their number in the rightist camp is hugely higher. But we are so used to them that we consider them natural, just as a believer in God accepts everything as will of God.

The reason the police in India is socially isolated from the general public and it is a taboo to visit a police station is because police are not looked on as human beings...  They are either cruel robots who execute orders or they are brave superhumans who got the job done..  There is no in between for us in the society...  Why are we not allowed to be human...??? Is it because to err is human???  People talk about Human Rights what about our Human Rights???  Why can't we have a bad day at work and sulk while all the other professionals can why can't we cry when we are hurt?  Why can't we smile when we want to...??? It is because of this mentality that the country's police is being socially isolated to the extent of disattachment from society...

China Claim South China Sea  China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly  Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off  India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty  If China Can Do For Their Mother Land  Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do) Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.

What happened to his promise of bringing back Swiss black money back to India. All false promises. What happened with demonetization, could he unearth back money?

He still imposed a worthless corrupt party on us. Thankfully I dint trust him during 2014 elections. And I will never trust him in my life. He was quietly sitting till now, and as he realized that it's time to prepare for 2019 elections he started coming to light. I think he would have got another worthless party paying him under table to campaign for them.
They shouldn't experiment with some solution created through their delusional minds and destroy rivers even further.
Also, a pet(the puppy) is as much part of the family as a child.

Thats the irony.. Sad
Its the same with Hindu's as well. Dont take his tweet seriously. Insteas read comments of others and know not everyone is like him.
Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
A secret weapon of BJP
presence of prestitutes like u in india is odious and ominous.

What he spoke on last friday was not as PM of our nation, but just as a congress leader only..so immature even after 9.5 years of ruling.

Appeasement policy by Congress govt is made people easy earning in the name of problem.so revoke Nehru s article 370 promote hard work in the place of appeasement

Anna Hazare is still quiet over the MP case where BJP persons were involved with ISI / Dadri lynching / Alwar lynching since he can not speak against BJP.  But  would speak against Kejriwal.

Any change is difficult ... n this one is a tough one ... its important that go through this process and honestly we dont have a choice but to trust our PM.. unfortunatly there is not credible opposition.. opposition is so downmarket ... so useless.. full of jokers.... no credible and weak opposition is also not good for our democracy ..... hope for the best and lets be with PM Modi....
Nd as i have been sying frm so long, he cud hve straightly complained in police station rather then tweeting that surely would have setup a better example.. Nd also i have been saying for so long that loudspeaker can be used bt in a controlled manner abiding by Indian Constitution

How come snapedeal can provide you cash at fees when you yourself have to queue for ur money...strange...first of its kind in world...
Present day politics has  auctioned it's sovereignty to caate, creed, religion and ofcourse money. No political philosophy can withstand the pressure of corruption and that has been proved in many places in the modern history. Why elsewhere take examp: of China, Russia, West Bengal,and Kerla  dol you find Marxs ideology achieved the goal? Can you explain why Mnisters were caught for disproportianate assests and charges of bribes in CHINA,RUSSIA and every where under left rules.? It was. Not is.

It doesn't befits to a man who started his career by performing in Jagrata where he used to sing whole night on loudspeaker to raise questions now on Azaan which lasts just from 1 to 3 mins. Also it would not be the first time he would have heard fajr azaan is he is from delhi. He is a clever man, he know he could also be rewarded like Akshay Kumar in future if he involves in religious debates.
Very sad
Yet, another case of drunk driving.

Haha its is the Almighty God who created us, our prophets and this whole universe..not any human or object has created the same..read ur authentic books like Vedas and see what is written there..it is clearly written in Vedas that God has no image and nothing is like God..so how can we consider that Krishna who was a human being was a God??

Poor people and farmers are suffering big time and they are definitely not black money hoarders. Real black money hoarders are sitting  in your meeting,  listening and clapping. I visited India and went to Haryana and talked to the farmers. None of the farmers were happy about govt policies. Pls do something for farmers.
You can beat aaj tak in the trp  Keep it up

His father did the right thing but the root cause of hatred is absence of humanity which should be taught at home. Jobless youth who are frustrated with life are the prime target for terror recruiters and something should be done to nip it.
Demonetisation is a good Idea but poorly implemented and people are suffering. The black money is in overseas and in the form of gold and properties. Modi is failed bringing the black money back and completely failed handling the situation and the GDP is has gone down by 1.2%. It will take 5 years for the indian economy to come back to normal state. The rupee lost 40 paise in the past one month and sensex is down. It will take minimum 6 months for the situation to come back to normal. remember we have only 4 printing press and can print only very limited amount of money per day. we cant print money overseas. people doesnt have money to spent and business are struggling. countries like america australia and uk took 10 years to move towards  digital transactions. It  will not happen in one night for god sake. for a country like india it will take 10 years mark my words. people have died standing lines and whole country is suffering. the worst Idea ever i still cant beleive he is feeling great about this. he cant even talk in the parliament about this.

The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group....... Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .  The reply by CAs :   Sir,  We have 82 crore voters   - 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this)   Balance.......... 20.5 crores   Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)  15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) ..   Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....  Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it....   .... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±  if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......  1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )  2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ... Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )  3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*  4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance   5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..  Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits....   As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...üòä *LET'S SPREAD THIS TO HONEST TAX PAYERS*

Pls dig down more to get actual thing,
‚ÄúHi üôÇ My name is Gurmehar Kaur. I am from Jalandhar, India. This is my dad Capt. Mandeep Singh. He was killed in the 1999 Kargil War. I was 2 years old when he died. I have very few memories of him. I have more memories of how it feels NOT to have a father. I also remember how much I used to hate Pakistan & Pakistanis because they killed my Dad. I used to hate Muslims too because I thought all Muslims are Pakistanis. When I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha. Because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father‚Äôs death. My mother held me back and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him. It took me a while to know but today I do. I have learnt to let go of my hate. It was not easy but its not difficult. If I can do it, so can you. Today, I am a soldier too, just like my dad. I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be here. I am making this video because I want the Governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France & Germany can become friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan & USA can put their past behind and work towards progress, then why can‚Äôt we?? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the calibre of leadership of both nations. We cannot dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please pull your socks up. Talk to each other and get the job done.Enough state sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is Enough. I wish to live in a world where there are no Gurmehar Kaurs who miss their Dad. I am not alone, there are many like me. #ProfileForPeace‚Äù.

You are given many Constitutional protections...However, reservation is not poverty alleviation scheme, it is there for only those social groups, historically who has been exploited, marginalized, rendered weaker.

If demonetisation couldn't deliver short term benefits then forget about long term benefits. Even the govt was expecting better short term benefits. If the 31% who voted for modi govt could have acted according to govt's day dream , the result would have been much better.    Short term benefits like terrorists' cash crunch doesn't have a life not more than a few months. About fake currencies we r already seeing what we were anticipating.   About the long term benefits. Any such benefits could have been achieved even without demonetisation. By giving incentives for cashless transactions and putting extra surcharges on cash transactions..

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

Bharat Mahendru So if anyone speak against Cow is a Muslim? üòÇ My Hindu friends eat cow and don't care what she is for them. They call her animal only. Apart from that Hindus kill her, slaughter her, smuggle them to Pak and Bangladesh via Assam and Kashmir with the help of BSF soldiers, kick her on roads, force them to eat plastics and garbage, let them die on roads bla bla bla bla. Isn't enough that many Hindus don't care about her? Even those who worship her?

If God change any man, no problem anyone bt if change govt. So everyone problems. What is this .....
Well at 1st it looks like dashing, deshbhakt video. Than I thought and realized what the hell he said that you or I don't know. What solution he has for all of us, in his video, And what does he mean to say on Kashmir or Pakistan. should Modi send army and start killing terrorist or attacking Pakistan for which militants will stand, Ok army will kill militants and jihadis, then what, did he said anything about so called secular, presstitutes, jaichands of nation or NGOs around the world which will defame India and world will apply trade sanctions on India. Yes India can survive with trade sanctions but what about OIL, Technology whcih is must needed to grow in 21st Centuary. Don't think this will not happen. Look at Syria's Sia leader Assad who is been targeted all around the world just because it is said that he is killing innocent Sunni. So how many sunni did he kill may be thousand but what america, europe doing with him. So what will happen when Indian armies goes to Kashmir or Pakistan and start killing all. World Powerful countries, NGOs, Jaichands, Political Parties all will criticize India and World may apply trade sanctions on India. Indian army and PM is capable of fetching POK and killing terrorist, militants from Kashmir . Our internal system has damages and holes, but govt. is working it. This whole Matter has to be solved properly by laws, making India Permanent member of UN, Entering into NSG, making Indian economy more powerful and self dependent, maintaining our culture, making politics clean. Modi is doing all this. What Kumar Vishwas is saying we all know this excluding his poems, But what he is doing in Kanhaya, Jaichands supporting Aam Aadmi Party than, indirectly may or may not be taunting Modi or trying to create aura like central govt. is doing nothing . While the fact is this government after 70 yrs is working to solve problems.
This is apparently not mainstream feminism. It may be your version of feminism.

In Tamilnadu, they haven't given, reservations on the basis of religion, it has a peculiar demographic distribution of castes, where, more than 76% of people belong to weaker sections of society, so it is shoved into the 9th schedule of the constitution of India.

Got it Mr. Singer ...but if you wish that your suggestion or speaking more appropriately ' a hindutva campaign against noise-pollution should be embraced then you ought to realise the trauma caused by your songs to people like me , and so in accordance to your statement you must stop singing.

Duplicate notes has been released in India of rupees 80lks of 500 and 1000 which was not in hands of gov or PM. Then there its self they declared as all that stuff. Any one asked about the reason behind the releasing of 2000 rupees note. I like only point also included black money need to take it out. There are a lot of question people need to asked. He is also the same like the other. I don'T trust him now. Is a fallalaa speech, Listen to the people voice who there are suffering now. we don't need yours speech. People are lost there life.

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

If we are able to stand away from political parties and view him as a parliamentarian , other MPs must emulate him in various aspects. We need not be a communist to appreciate him as a parliamentarian. Problem now is we just jump in with saber in hand to finish one personality just cos he belongs to a party. Many parties have good MPs like him , but out of party affiliation to one party or other we just spew venom on others. Better debates by MPs decide  the future of good democracy.

All on a sudden, USA , Turaska are showing interest to mediate Kashmir issue and India negating , so, slowly world politics are getting concern about Kashmir, while Pakistan is welcoming the move , India sticks to bilateral resolve of the issue . Attacks on Uri  and Pathankot are the biggest failure of India, which is really a great concern and observed that after those two incidents have made other country very much enthusiastic over Kashmir issue. Naturally from strategic point of view India has to reassess the internal security aspect before entering to all out conflict . It is also observed, that ex generals have concede the intelligence failure in respect of Uri and Pathankot incidents . It is also to be asserted that , how far this type of failure is rooted?  This is very much embarrassing situation.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

These spokespersons take all obligations from their respective parties. They will come out with all sort of talks to defend it. It'll not lead us anywhere. Report report report it so many times that these acts are not forgotten. Lives of our jawans are not that important to these political puppets..
And you have a problem with that? When BJP has assigned all of the 7 Delhi MPs and Modi has asked his Cabinet ministers to campaign and Amit Shah is himself looking after a simple 'MCD"" elections, then probably you should understand the gravity of these MCD elections. But sorry, you may have taken monies to keep your mouth shut against BJP and projecting, irrelevantly,  AAP in a bad light. :D
Why not stop printing brand name by law, why onus on doctors?
Great!! AAPtards are abusing the man who gave that dumbshit Arvind Kejriwal and identity!!! Seriously, Anna Hazare will be feeling pity on himself :( :( :( :(

Not only black money will get affected  Rupee gets better when it starts rotating in the economy  Hawala business stopped now And like this so many
How can you say that bro? It is the duty of the citizens and the government to care for the minority. Have you heard if the islamic country Bahrain? Do you know how peaceful its there. Watch and learn, a monarchy so good that gives rights, safety,care to all cultures and religions. And back in India, our home we fight amongst ourselves. Why? Eat what you want. Majority and minority shouldnt matter. Its not like we are killing people. Beef for life!

In 2015 the educated people voted for educated minister an iitian , a former IRS and a social activist. 2015 to 2017 he is working for people betterment media don't show it as it is paid . We trust him n his team and we will again vote for him... We are really pissed of from corrupt mcd . People earning crores from mcd and people of Delhi are just pissed off
Jaswinder Bhai y this stupid question from me....I m not a bjp or rss man......  Rather I think u AAP guys should be happy....coz the campaigning by large number of big wigs from bjp for just MCD elections, is going to help Kejriwal only & create a negative image for bjp - ke saara kaam kaaj chod kar Municipal council elections me lagge hai......... I as a Delhi sensible Delhi citizen would take it negatively.....  So instead of abusing........ u AAP guys should thank BJP for this foolish move.......coz it will again strengthen the image of Kejriwal/AAP only at national level...
I am a big fan of Modiji but what about the BJP leaders who have a plenty of black money like....
This is the real topic but unfortunately we stuck in religion politics

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

From the time BJP has come to power all I see, is false promises, Gunda raj, GauRaksha, riots, etc. and people like you who are defending it and actually abusing the harmony which once was good between different communities.

When we drive abroad in other countries, traffic fines are huge due to which people take driving as a responsible & careful affair. Drunk driving is 6 months straight jail in some countries.  In India, we shift lanes without indicating, drive drunk, stand after the stop line at red signal and jump them without thinking twice of the serious implications. Non-existence of emergency lanes on roads. People not giving space to Ambulance & other emergency vehicles. I also lost my mother while in ambulance just because few people had more important places to reach and blocked our way. Believe me your perspective of driving would change completely when you are in a situation like that one.  So I fully support government's decision to make the fines at par with the global norms and hope that all the traffic violators get what they actually deserve.
they are not cowards this is the reality media is showing wrong

In my view, dirty cash flow during Election Process can be checkmated if one keeps a close watch upon 2nd & 3rd ranking leaders & helpers - not party workers like personal drivers or typists across spectrum & all banking daily withdraws of around Rs. 20000.00 in relation to their economic, social & political statuses & overall local economic activities of local Economic Heavyweights across economic spectrum & credit bills above Rs. 10000/day of businesses like resturants, event organisers/business houses etc‚úî

Working or not working is a personal choice..the way Mira minds people having judgements about her being a house maker the same way she shouldn't be judgemental about women who work after having babies  Working after babies no where means these women love their kids any less than she..some don't have a choice due to financial constraint..some choose it because they want to..as simple as that

Let us call a spade a spade Anna ji. You will go down in history as the person who ushered an era of Anarchy in the country. Atleast one generation will pay the price for having supported your so called followers. Harsh words, i am afraid, but true. Truth hurts, doesn't it?

RSS people starts boiling when any body says about secularism and start giving their own bised definition of secularism. This communal thought was first inducted by Sarwarkar in the year 1910 in Indian freedom straggle and and terminated at the birth of  RSS in 1925 along with another communal organisation MUSLIM  LEAGUE. These organisations seldom taken part in the straggle of India.

Who is speaking? Head of a party who execute with the cruelest methods any one who are found to be a threat to their growth, even their own cadres or Leaders who may desert Party. Even Mussolini or Hitler will shudder if they see the method of murders this inhuman party did. They failed miserably in West Bengal. Now many right thinking citizens are rejecting the polarisation jumla of both Congress who are habitual corrupt and Communists whose DNA is political murders and joining BJP refusing to be mislead by their Vote Bank Lies of communalism. Vijayan's party as well Cingress are scared and worried about the erosion of their cadres to BJP and hence unleashed a dirty devilish Malicious  Communal Campaign coupled with murders and clashes on BJP. But this has become outdated and Congress is swept to a corner in Centre. Same experience will meet CPIM and Congress again.

Such a horrible article. Quotes the Pope on Marxism as if he is the authority to go by. The highest income inequality today is in Russia of all countries and yet Marxism is the panacea. The attempts to create Marxist utopia have given us horrors of Stalin, pol pot, Mao, Castro, and Hugo Chavez and yet this belief of infallibility of Marx hasn't gone. It is almost if Marxism itself is a religion.

CASH- LESS...That is Modi's dream.Don't tell me that he has achieved it so faast !!..I don't quite trust the Russian diplomat?!!!!
It has to be a 'military 'retaliation and not diplomacy. Paskistan does not believe in diplomacy because they don't believe in it. They believe in combat with weapons that were given to them free by their coalition partners viz U S and some middleeast countries. They have no money to buy weapons
My friend 1400 crore has been spend in 2014 election by BJP. Which is most expensive election campaign ever in India. 42% of the total money had spend on media for fake or brain washing publicity.

TN State Govt had requested Central To Sanction Drought relief Scheme Funds But Central Govt didn't addressed Till Now?? Agriculture Ministry Says Financial Burden for UP farmer's loan waiver shall Takeover By Central Exchequer ,Why Not for other Farme's across the Nation?? #Agri Ministry says Farmer's Lost their Lives due failure & Incomptance.  I Hope Honour Narendr Modi Shall remember that he Is Prime Minister of  Nation Not only For Uttar Pradesh.
A man self obsessed with religious ideology even in friendship couldn't be a trustworthy. Let him go back without any further talks.

Haha.Modi said demonetization will remove fake notes & black money. Nobody can remove corruption. And now fake money.

He is considered to be hardliner.By appointing him CM ,BJP is going to give the message it is serious about the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya.
Covering AAM from GOVt schemes is OK. But Delhiwalas don't want to see the face of Kejri as well.
printing new notes cost money and those banned costed and was all waste .. why dosent he get forign bank details of his political party people
RM and Sushma Swaraj are the only working people in BJP. Rest are just religious politics and campaigning...

It should b one same like demonitization... It is rather an informed measure to take the rectification step to avoid mistake
Some messages shows how they got their hands burn by demonisation
Correct decision but horrible implementation ! Next steps for any honest PM including him:- 1) All elections to be funded by the Election commission thru special credit cards issued to the extent allowed.  2) All parties to abide by the limit in case any candidate found exceeding limit he should be declared the looser even if he had won. 3) immediately enforce BTT ( Bank transaction tax which should not. E more than 2% of the value used. 4) No income tax to be more than 10% 5) Sack any one found guilty of corruption without any recourse to courts. Amend service laws  6) Cover the agriculturists by tax which should not exceed 5%

At least Arvind Kejriwal has done something for the society at large. Anna, hand in glove with BJP, is thinking at it's lowest mental level. Shameful !!!!
WTF, a ruling party is not allowed to have their office in the state, Anna Hazare dont know how many offices BJP, Congress, SP, BSP have in Delhi and in other states....
maybe you need to research more on why there are Maoists in that part of india in the first place. Understanding the problem will give you a wider perspective and maybe even how to better deal with them.

Such comment by such a public figure is quite annoying bcoz we should not b against such sort of things as we live in a country with a lot of cultural and religious diversity so if people r mentioning  such sort of creepy things where everyone of us live in brotherhood inspite of all this we should respect everyone's feeling and believe

Hey dreamcatcher govt... Just look as to what's happening at the border I.e., LOC. Innumerous soldiers are being martyred every now and then.

Thanks.  Sincerely, An indian

India is a Hindu country, secularism is a slow but sure way to convert it into Islamic. As soon as muslims are in majority, all this talk of secularism will be meaningless.  You will find a vast majority of Indian muslims sympathetic to the Saudi regime style shariat laws, banning of other religions in most Islamic countries and justifying the Islamic practices. Many are openly speaking of support for Fatwas against those who speak their minds....they attack those who say the truth. Examples of Tarek Fateh and Taslima Nasreen are there for all to see.  Secularism is only a tool to deceive Hindus.   Secularism is not a one way street, are muslims secular? If not, india should never make the mistake of being secular.
This is not some mullah nation to jail people for getting seperated. If you want a divorce, man up like every one else, go through the courts, go through counseling, commit to alimony and child support. This is not 7th century.
This is a start of a political reengineering process. Those political parties who are opposing demonetization have already started reading the writings on the wall. They will not be able to play politics in the name of poor, the method hitherto  being followed, as poor is going to be a state of past. All political parties are not yet equipped to face that situation and hence the hue and cry. Good luck Mr. PM. Let's keep our fingers crossed.

Then he reduces the fees to Rs. 50 but this time too he hardly gets any visitor.. Frustrated the Entrepreneur finally slashes the fees to mere Rs. 10 and still gets deprived of visitors..  He ultimately announces free entry to the Zoo and the greedy masses flock to the Zoo.. He gets elated to see such awesome response to the scheme.. The smart Entrepreneur releases the hungry wild animals from the Zoo and charges whooping Rs. 10000 per person for Exit.. The helpless crowd left with no choice pay that money for their life..

Long back charges on withdrawal were introduced but later had to withdraw. It is unethical. Bank fully utilize clients funds and it was held illegal. Better checkup past experience.
A way of thinking : it's not a loss it's an aggregate of savings of per capita household income, savings of hospital expense caused due to accidents after drink and drive , savings on every house income that goes to govt which is earned by either the lady of the house or the man which can now be spent on something better, savings on the stress caused due to fights between the wife and husband due to drinking, savings on the physical abuse happening in so many homes, saving the child from watching the trauma caused by the fights between his or her mom dad
The ""reason"" behind the loss in UP is very easy to explain. Pimp Shriman Pappu Maharaj riding bicycle üö≤ with Akhilesh had flat tires . It could not therefore meet their constituents waiting for free laptops and iPhone.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake
So true this old man is funded by rss and bjp
I was in RSS from 1951 to 1957 and was regularly attending sakha. But one incident compalled me to leave this oganisation.

U got her wrong...  Killing innocents was also a part of our freedom struggle...  Remember General Dyre did this in Jallianwala Bagh...  So she is justified in saying the ppl who committed the murder were innocent, just like the way General Dyre was, and later the British public showed solidarity towards him..  Everything was a part of the 200 yr long struggle...
Logistics ... the government could have airlifted them from the minting sites!!
National highways and Expressways are Govt top priority area now-a-days but the whole concept of expressway would be thwarted by rapid growth of commercial / industrial and residential construction along the expressways/bypass made to allow traffic move outside the city. Step should be taken by Govt immediately to stop this practice and Law should be framed to stop construction upto 200 meter on both side of the road, all such construction should be demolished.
Your form of secularism promoting killing opponents can't be understood. Stop this non-sense worshiper of Blood (Red).
And you blind Bhakths believe that our EVMs are not tampered with ? You deserve this :D !!

Lotus is our national flower. I like the lotus very much it doesn't mean I like BJP. What the hell!

I cannot enjoy 'orange colour' because it is said to be colour of BJP. what are these happening everywhere? Did BJP get copyright on Lotus or Orange colour?

No single person/ company can fund such a huge sum. It means that the producers will form a consortium to borrow funds from the public or the banks which means that you and I being a depositor or a investor will be bearing the credit risk of this project.

Muhammad Shiraz Sabir: dude. Try to embrace the truth. It's the congress govt who has done all these. It has divided Hindu Muslim for the last 70 years for their own politics.  So everybody abused Modi as an anti Muslim when he refused to wear a Muslim cap. But see what Modi did after election. He went to mosque and offered his prayer there in some Arab country i guess.

In Goa and in Manippur, the Congress party is the single largest party, just away from majority.  Therefore, it should have been invited by the Governors to form the Government.  By manipulating the mandate, the BJP is trying to form Government in these states and thereby insulting democracy,.

Ofcourse is every single represetatives duty to protect and trains his community, specially wen attrocities, harrasing,and genocide happen to minorities such as Christians,Muslims and dallit Hindus from upper cast rulers and its affiliate groups
We said sir, once I was also a staunch supporter of AAP and AK but all my hopes are dashed now as they are now behaving like any other party.They should understand that ppl of Delhi gave them such a big majority only because they thought AAp is not like other parties.They should introspect after big defeat in Punjab and Goa and change their way of politics.AK should get rid of idiots like sanjay singh,ashutosh,khetan, pandey as these leaders have no credibility nd cant even win mohalla election on their own.They r the ones spoiling AK's mind.AK should take advice only from Kumar Vishwas because he is the only one in this party who is intelligent,sharp,commands respect everywhere.Even BJP scares of targetting Kumar as they know if he starts speaking,no one has capability to counter him.
Loss of our soldiers is a national loss.The protectors r killed n the killers stand protected.We r worried how far the nation will bear such burden of songs without substance.

Let us now take up BJP files and appoint committees they would not be of small wrong doings like AAP. I do not condone small but they can be corrected and they are not so severe as the inflammatory statement dividing India by various so called leaders of ruling party of country. Not to mention the honesty. If for gains they are willing to undermine idea of India and unity, for them corruption would be a cake.

Thank you very much for your kindness to update me about it. I wish you would know that I am equally connected to the media as you are.

Mohammad Javeed I completely agree with you Javeed Bhai.. so many people  sacrificed their lives to get freedom to our country, if those people had stopped fighting because so many people were dying, we would not be what we are now. These people too can be ranked so, I pay respects for them and I hope no more deaths will happen due to this decision. Their efforts will certainly bring fruits for our future generation without any deviation.

Talking about equality. I think she can debate with herself on her statements. üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Also it's not just about being lucky or not. Ofcourse that can be one of the possibilities. However,  there are ample of women in this world who are lucky/privileged enough to sit at home and stay with their kids. And they choose to be still Working Moms. This is because they were raised to be independent and are raising their kids to be the same.   They are neither running away from their kids nor neglecting them. They just want them to be the best at every situation be it lucky or not.  So, be proud all you Working Moms. You are creating a better world for you and for me and the entire world. :)

I am watching carefully to all the parties, they are all attacking BJP but not for the work Bjp has done, they are attacking BJP only on nonsense issue like Dadri where the Central government doesn't have any role. It's means Modi government is working good in Center.
If u cAn't change any things and even don't want to support a person who work for change so u don't have any rights to comment anything wrong :I support  change I support my PM
The moment GurMehar took her Martyred Army Father's name to publicize her support for separatism, it can no more be counted as just her personal opinion.  If she had made that statement without taking refuge in martyrdom of her father then only it could have been treated as a personal opinion.  As of now her statement implies that her Ex-Army father and even many in Indian Army too would have been in support of her statement.

Rajbeer Singh: Dude are you serious..??? In what sense she was right..?? what was her motive to show those Placards..?? His father gave his life to save the country in a war.. In the same was Captain Saurabh Kalia was arrested by love our peaceful neighbor but the way he was killed shows how much only wars affect any country but not the other country involved... Dude even we too have captured Pakistanis during the war but never gave them what we got from them. Remember 96K Bangladeshi soldier's surrender..?? They never died such horrific death...   Going against the country is now the latest and the fastest route to come into the Limelight. Ask the survivors of the martyr soldiers about how much they love our neighbor.. Are we so blind that we can't see what kind of politics these people are doing in the country..?? Being in the opposition doesn't mean to oppose everything of the ruling party to that extent which makes you anti-national...   Yeah.. I am not with any party's IT cell to promote them... These are my personal views on the liberals and young leaders like Hardik Patel Kanhaiya Kumar etc who are showing a brilliant way of success to the youth which will enlighten their path for the future of the country.. Doesn't matter its bright or dark...
Perhaps AAP could field Ghuggi or Bhagwant Mann here...
The only problem govt facing from the opposition now, is queues in bank and 100 rs. shortage in atms. this can be easily solved. order all banks, on warfoot measure to install POS machines in all milk booths, govt provisional stores, petrol bunks buses and trains and all other retail outlets. popularise with tv advts of pay tms and sbi buddy and all other fund transfer modes. remember millions and millions of debit cards remain idle with the public, and they are not only for withdrawing cash from atm. if these are applied simaltaneously, the situation will ease very quickly. Take steps today itself and very important thing is make the public aware these steps are being taken at a rapid pace and things will become normal very soon. At least if these measures are successful in metros and urbans, there will be plenty of availablity of cash notes which can be sent to rural areas. all depends how fast you act making the public aware govt is solving the problem
This is a propaganda of india just to divert the killings of kashmiris by hindu army and also killing of muslims In india by bjp thugs.this all to show turkey a pakistan brother that Indians r innocent

Is it really a fight against Blackmoney? If it is then why exemption for political parties which are the big offenders.How much has been recovered from Swiss and other F.Banks?

Lame duck prime minister of a lame duck government, and was just a rubber stamp, neither he nor his party could take any wise decision for the progress of our country, but corruption was at its peak during their regime.  Now when someone is taking some hard core decisions, they are not able to digest it and trying to make a mockery of politics.  As far as degrees and diplomas are concerned, one doesn't need them to run the nation honestly and wholeheartedly with so many intellectuals around to do the work...
why don't you speak in parliament...why do you bubk parliament..??

Anna Hazare is playing to the tunes of BJP. He is silent about all the wrong doings of BJP. There may be some problems in the rule of Kejriwal, maybe he is a sort of authoritarian, but with his limited powers, he has implemented lot of welfare measures. We shouldn't ignore that. While the BJP on the other hand is undoing India. They are killing the social fabric and a man like Anna Hazare is maintaining a dreadful silence. The attack against Africans, dalits, minorities in the name of beef, where were Anna then?

It's not correct bro. 1- Not every IITians get hefty packaged offers from US or other big country. Those who get are very few. Really very few.

I pay approx 3 lakhs per annum as fees but still don't find that level of facilities.

And anyway she spoke only for herself, not for the world. Then why is everyone offended? And why is it necessary to have social validations to prove your identity ? Isn't being a good human being an identity. True equality will come the day when both stay at home moms and DADS are given equal respect as working men and women.

This is pathetic decision, I feel BJP government is acting against the common Public. The decisions Govt is taking has to be perfect and it should not boomerang on Govt.  Firstly BJP Govt first decision on Demonization has failed in collecting the Black Money from Market and even there is cash crunch in market. If BJP government will take such haphazard decision then public will show non-cooperation on each and every action. Timely rethink on haphazard decisions.

It may appear rude to working mothers, but Mrs. Kapoor is just stating the fact that she is happy that she has the choice of being there for her child everyday. She understands that her love for her child is more important than the peer pressure of the times to get a job to boost one's ego. It may be difficult for the middle class working mothers to do the same, as they are working to supplement her husband's income and thus ensure a decent life for her family and dependents. It is a shame when wives of rich successful men, get jobs through their husband's recommendations and support, performing part-time mother duties. These positions could have been suitably filled by another needy person, man or woman, that could help another family overcome their hardships. Feminism is a joke in such cases.
correct sir.. backward leader consider backward caste as their fixed vote bank and by getting some vote from forward caste they will win their election so if they raised this point which is happened in GATE exam then their politics will be in trouble...and most of our backward  leader are unaware about  gate exam.....

We don't have the right to complain but to shut up and follow. Today, you have set India as an example for Venezuela, Australia and many more to come. Hoping for a good new year ahead. A different new year..

Our prime minister was saying demonitisation must have done in1971 that time inflation was too high due to Bangladesh liberation war and due to drought if demonitisation was done at that time people reeling under inflation might have died if they can't get employment what is happening today the casual labour and farmers are the most affected today allover digitalisation is their but at that time even electricity was a luxury
What about buerocrats ans minsters of all parties including BJP

http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/  Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake

Is this the same Vemula who faked he is Dalit and was milking the country, enjoying benefits meant for others?
This post isn't about IIT at all. It's about a student who thought he is going to the right place, only to realise mid-way that he wants his destination changed!! The title and subtitle of the article are misleading. The matter and the title are VERY different. And as Indians aren't good at argumentation anyway, even the readers are discussing the title and not the body of the article!! Lol

I disapprove of loud speakers in our churches as well
Suhas Shilker You must have heard or read about scuffles, riots, murders etc when a person from different community objects to loud noise from bhajans. I also experience this constant loudspeaker noise from nearby temple but I have to bear with it to avoid communal tensions.
Modiji break the barns and  feed the poor break mills and cloth the poor and break property builders and give shelter to the poor and open the water lines and give the poor. Money is paper and only makes life miserable
Anna ji where is lokepal bill where is your seculiyarism better you were some other dress not Gandhi topi
Anna Hazare  is a failure. He could neither introduce a Lok Pal Bill, as he wished, nor could produce a political party to counter Congress and BJP. He shouldn't have started any movement and to produce opportunist leaders like Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi who used him.
What an actor, he is:-P may be after 2019 he will be a part of hera pheri 3B-)

What sort of a justice is this when there is no concern for loss of jobs and loss of revenue ?  Didn't the govt have any advocate  to  represent it  in court? Was the order an ex parte one ?
but anyone can speak against wrong deeds specially when someone disable 90 % of people to get their money from their accounts and eventually disable all middle and lower section people to get basic needs of life including food...... u know what i mean by 90%
What kind of report need high command ? Its simple Gandhi family. Until through out Gandhi family from congress it can't win...

I just want to say that media works only for own TRP. Media never like to arise the grievances of an ordinary people. I have news that on 8-12-12 an 18 year old went to tuition and never returned back and family found her body in nearby mortuary after 4 days on 12-12-12. Stunning thing is that the parents of the girl lodged missing report on the same day and girl was killed on railway track on 8-12-12 & police recovered the body on the same day. Police has no time to even collect her PM report & investigation is yet not started to allow the culprits to erase the evidences. No news paper/channel dared to show the news as it has no worth for them. A police person was killed in agitation at India Gate and PM report came to police within 24 hours and MS of Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital is summoned by the police to be appear in their office.
Whatever the analysis, if America comes first, it always seems like faking it.

Kejriwal should resign immediately. .if he has some dignity left
my simple question......soldiers got killed with fire....how come their bodies were mutilated ?? this shows they were in Pakistani territory.....and if they were in Pakistani territory they were surely at wrong place and met their fate....and as far as mutilation is concerned this claim is absurd......neither we mutilate nor we use humans as shield like indian army does.....this is how we treat soldiers ....ur very dear chandu Lal chohan

You know it just baffles me how despite so much education and information around, people like you ask such dumb questions. Could you just define what a true Hindu, Muslim or a Christian is supposed to be like? By all means feel free to come to Kerala and do your survey yourself as to whether Hindus here eat buffalo or cow beef. By the way I also have Kerala Muslim friends who drink also. (Jinnah btw ate pork and drank too) So you can do a simultaneous survey on how many true Muslims are there in Kerala. And do remember to share your survey results with everybody. It will be enlightening. Like I said in my comment, Kerala, it's food practices and culture is beyond the understanding of most North Indians like you.
Shunglu report is ok  What about mcd.  Delhi Most corrupted corporation in India led by BJP.

A speech full of just superficial ideas. Mr. Modi look down to common men . See where he is right now. Ur just blah blah blah blah blah. Nothing else. No ground reality.
Why  u did like this, GODSE body still revered in India
being highly educated and learned and not using any of it for the benefit of the country is useless... i have also stood in lines for hours and not only seen poor people stand but also people who drove Mercedes and BMW's getting out of their cars and standing in queues. Thats y i said not everything you read is true. If you have read the Bible... God bought a flood when only Noah and his ark and all that was inside his ark was safe. do you know y ???? if not please find out y... No religion teaches bad things its people who do bad. We all have comments on everybody and everything... Also, please go back in time when the Puppet was a PM and you will come to know alot of things that happened but nobody spoke about it... neways... you take care and time will tell us... lets leave this to time... take care and all the best buddy....

I was personally fan and become bound to watch his alliance and particularly Mr Kumar Vishwas and his own made talent  including poet one,I believe that,*Zinke andaj shairana note gain,oonke jajbat aashikana vote hai*but what I get ,seriously I want to say * Aap aap ho gate bavajah,hum   tum ho gaye be vajah.Sorry to say you have lost not only yourself but believe of common Indians,who started to store power and confidence to stood before malapersonalities.
It was bound to happen . ... what chances did pak have in intellect with India . .... a country who compares Indian mars mission with their low quality missile test ... how can one think that they can even compete with India who is not just a super power in technology but also has a  soft power skills .......
First of all this is our constitution mistake to farm uniform civil code.if  Previous govt  could have do it earlier it will not be discussable matter to day.

The pot cannot call the Kettle black ??  India loses the right to accuse other for the same crime that India itself commits routinely to others. India has killed 57 Bangladeshi Army officers in a staged rebellion in Bangladesh who bodies are totally mutilated. India extra-judicially kills Bangladesh Border villagers almost everyday. India has been recently killing its own Muslim citizens for the crime of eating or wanting to eat beef.
so are you saying that this puppet was not responsible for anything that happened in the country for the last so many years.... come on....
Please stop such nonsense statement. No results come from any talks. They are not at all worth of it. So tackle the situation as per the demand and betterment of the nation.
One more swine
Congress did in 70 year BJP did in 30 min
It appears so because after becoming her C.M anti -national activities has increased.
In other words, Indian Army is saying Pakistani soldiers went across the LoC into Indian side, Mutilated the bodies of two Indian soldiers and came back while no one on the Indian side dared them engage.  #surgicalstrike üòè

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
We have a Lady sub-inspector in sec-7, cda, cuttack.  She takes bribes from criminals to protect them.  Have asked officials to refrain her from using Laal Batti PCR vehicle until vigilance takes care of her.... Vigilance sitting with her reports from 2015. She has filed cases against victims for hitting her with iron -rods.  After getting hit with iron-rods she actually and sincerely gets pregnant and avails maternity leave.  Her pregnancy outcome : First Iron baby daughter of odisha.  We have requested everyone locally to bless the iron - baby so vitamin deficiencies could be cured.

//17-year old RSS worker Ananthu in Alappuzha, 20-year old BJP worker Nirmal in Thrissur, 44-year old BJP worker Jayakumar in Thrissur and a few others.// I think it is better to mention specifically who killed these BJP workers. otherwise they will definitely add these name to the incidents of 'brutal one sided killing' of BJP workers in kerala. it is sanghis and spreading lies is their game!
Forget about religion and tell if anyone take such strong decisions in favour of country?

If BJP wins UP he will go to NDA that will be the end of opposition.
That means he is not the right leader and he fails to control his subordinates
Megharaj u may have not read the actual news , that i understood from ur 1st comment.
At times like these I feel sorry for parents who sacrifice so much to bring up their kids, only to be let down by the same child. Can't even begin to try and empathise with this man's state of mind at the moment. I wonder what he and his wife might be going through at such a difficult time. Almighty please don't ever punish any parent the way you are punishing this couple. He turned out to be an ungrateful son and eventually an ungrateful Indian. Shame!! I do however feel that his fTher should have him buried the dead need to be put to rest who ever they might be. I doubt any of us will question this poor old man's patriotism if he puts his son to rest. Please burry him.

I return, interviewed a couple of people on their way out. But while I interviewed the last family, I hear some noise, quite different from ‚ÄòHar Har Modi‚Äô or the ‚ÄòModi Modi‚Äô chant across the 7th Avenue.

Y I don't see common people suffering haan those people who have kept their money in high amount with them are barking alot if u were having high amount of money then u would have put it in your bank account and have paid tax to the government from.starting then we all wouldn't have suffered.....so give chance to him also as we have given the corruption leader in past.....give him a chance might the situation will get changed......

It somehow seems strange how this quaint old man suddenly decides to speak only when there are elections around the corner, and that too only against Arvind Kejriwal. Why not the tremendous amount of good the AAP is doing among the really poor and voiceless Mr. Hazare? Or maybe you have not been told all that???

Great. So now you forgot that Lotus is our National flower.
The Court has done justice. There should not be any restriction, ban on food for the human beings to eat. Look in the west & the rest of the world the stores are full of all sorts of food, vegetarian/ non- vegetarian, beef, pork, mutton. Chicken all sorts. The choice is there, all the customers Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains Muslims etc. They go to these store & buy what they like, every one has the freedom to choose , to eat they like. Why India is so intolerant, so narrow minded ?
I started hating sonu nigham from today.......and will till death
Gopal Tripathi.there must be a ban on all noise pollution including the night long devinavaratri bhajans where sonu Nigam sells his sound pollution causing voice for money.at that time sonu Nigam and his ilk forget their devotion is other 's sound pollution. Azan lasts only 2 or 3 min.usually very few non Muslims live in the vicinity of a masjid.
Horrible state of common people. All suffering. He has no understanding the ordeal people r going  thru

It's his wish. Who is this mullana preaching others and interfaring in others religious beliefs ? He's also a citizen of India and have his own religious freedom. Being a CM doesn't mean he do stop believing in the faiths of his religion.
Ahmad ji you are absolutely right.  Anna is not talking about Gau Raksha case. And other thing don't  worry about these bhakts.  Because they are blind. They can't see what is happening or what may happen.

Eat less spicy Ur colon will thank u and Facebook posts also
if demonetization was implemented without being discussed in parliament ( which is the SOP for any reform, irrespective about corrupted politician ) which Modi thought was right, then why other reform like GST,  abolition of reservation, Janlokpal etc are being kept for discussion in parliament. Comeon see dream, wake-up and pass the bill on your own...
All those who kill their wives or abandon them have a special place of Honor within the BJP.
I agree, that there is no point of making a goon a CM, who will decide whether he is a goon or not?
He is bought up by bjp
Perfect example of SOLD media house. Just like SONIA/RAHUL GANDHI who will sell anything ifthe price is right.
He is against of india
I lived in a area where there were 2 Mandirs and 1 Masjid I never got disturbed in Ganesh chaturti even if the loud speakers started at 6 am in morning and went on till the night. I still remember when the Azan used to start all the loud speakers used to be turned off by their respective people. It never occurred to me that they were doing wrong because I believed it was important to them and I respected that... Have respect for everyone's faith Mr Sonu Nigam and you wouldn't get disturbed.

Q1) Are GDP data fudged?  - Yes, they are. They aren't accurate. They are being fudged to promote a lie.  Q2) Can you prove that the GDP data are fudged?  - Until January'2015, Indian economy was witnessing its worth growth since the mid 1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) changed the way it calculates GDP saying that it was necessary to do so keeping in view the global practices. As a result, India outpaced China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14 our economy grew at 6.9%, rather than 4.7%, which the CSO data showed earlier. Even the country's chief economic advisor, Arvind Subramanian, said ‚ÄúI am puzzled by the new GDP growth numbers. The revised numbers show GDP growth rose from 4.7% to 5.1% for 2012-13 and from 5% to 6.9% for 2013-14. This means acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, just by comparing the new numbers across time"". He also said ""these numbers, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macro economy"". Almost every economic expert, working in or out of the government ( including Mr Raghuram Rajan), questioned the GDP numbers as they found that the ground realities reflected a completely opposite picture. The new GDP numbers seemed completely in conflict with other economic indicators. According to R Nagraj , an independent member of the sub-committee that examined the new methodology to estimate output, the version adopted by the Central Stastical Organisation differed dramatically from the report finalised by the sub-committee in September 2014.  Q3) What about the latest GDP data released post-demonetization?  - They too are fudged. While the performance of few sectors have been better when compared to their performance in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems highly doubtful amidst the cash crunch during demonetization. It seems that the CSO hasn't been able to map the demonetization effect in its data. Both the government and RBI have also been saying ( just like few of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be mapped over a longer time-frame. Also, the CSO revised DOWN the Q3 estimates of 2015-16 by 0.3 percentage point to 6.9% from 7.2% earlier, which led to considerable improvement in Q3 2016-17 figures. For those who don't find it surprising, the CSO revised UP Q1 and Q2 estimates of 2015-16. This downward revision of Q3 of 2015-16 has helped in restricting the effect of demonetization in figures.  Q4) I am not able to understand anything. Why?  - You won't be able to get it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Everytime reports and claims like these surface, hustle a little bit on internet beyond Facebook and Twitter, and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.  Q5) But Modi ji says experts know nothing. Don't you think that he is right?  - After Hindutva, the best tactic Modi ji has got is misinformation. He has convinced people in believing that experts know nothing. He misinforms people who don't know anything but to believe him. They don't have enough time or will to find out the truth. And when experts question his claims and him, people never understand what experts are saying because they aren't educated enough to understand.

I totally agree with  you Meenaxi Gautam......
That is not going to solve the problem. We are not limited to MP and MLA elections, we have so many other elections like local body elections, by-elections, etc., and so on. We need to eliminate as many elections as possible because that will reduce the scope for fake currency as well. If an elected representative dies in office, the runner-up candidate should be given the responsibility rather than conducting another election. An elected government can't fall at the behest of few selfish politicians. We need to change rules to make the elected representatives to complete the term or even share power across party lines when there is no clear majority. Conducting elections after elections are bleeding this country.

Mohammad Ashfaq Siddiqui I don't know what part of the news didn't you understand when the killer mistook him for an arab. The fact is there is more chances for Indians to to be alive and live peacefully in U.S if he/she is a hindu ofcourse unless a white is brainwashed by muslims into killing Hindus which I think the probability of that happening is high.

Since 2014 each and every decision of our PM only made me respect him more but this one I could not digest....  No ""Yogi"" pls, to make our nation better we need more educated and qualified strong administrator. I hate Pseudo-seculars and equally hate those who runs people fooling business based on any religion.  Hope I am wrong about the new UP chief Minister , at least this govt would prove me wrong.
He himself is surviving on his wife's salary , he is just venting out his frustration of being unemployed ‚ò∫üòú
I am not sure whether this is practical, but if you look at familiar spots frequented by people that will give an idea where it needs to be located. Also no one should be saying 'NO' to use the loo even if it's in private area, that is the way we can keep our environment clean.
Dictatorship is going on
What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.  In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government
Whatever wipro is growing but what is happening in the root is not notified by anyone which is very bad. If someone is going to come for audit then that person use to come before the audit days and use to inform everything what he is going to do .

One of the worst title given by Indian Express and these days this has become habit of Indian express to put their own mind in every topic.
Mutilating the dead bodies is a war crime under Geneva Conventions. Allegations of Pakistani forces mutilating the two Indian soldiers today are serious and should be investigated impartially. Indian soldiers in the past themselves have been involved in mutilating the dead bodies, not just of combatants but civilians too. In March 2000 at Pathribal, 5 civilians were killed in a stage managed encounter and their bodies burnt, to avoid recognition. The CBI investigation charged a present Indian army General as an accused but army scuttled the prosecution. All such war crimes should be investigated and the culpable punished, whether Pakistani army, Indian army or even militants.
No need of selecting we have elected Modi now itself...

The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group....... Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .  The reply by CAs :   Sir,  We have 82 crore voters   - 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this)   Balance.......... 20.5 crores   Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)  15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) ..   Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....  Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it....   .... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±  if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......  1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )  2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ... Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )  3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*  4. Introduce medica

Of course, when majority community is so bad, that they even have problem to rent house to Muslims. When fanancial status of Muslims is degrading for their business not running, not getting enough jobs in private sector etc, then it's government duty to give reservation, and act as role model.

India was divided on the basis of religion but Nehru made her Secular for his benefits.  He is at the root of most of the problems that this country is facing now.  Secularism is nothing but a very effective tool for appeasement of minorities for the sake of electoral politics.

it should be conceded that IITs are too much of an intellectual luxury .  They are expected to create more technocrats and scientist and Engineers.  I dare say more 80 % of the IITIANS are in non technical jobs.  Mostly in finance and banking and marketing.  The government should view that seriously.  Only the hardcore engineering aspirants must be given seats in IITS.  Successive RBI governors are IITIANS.
Hang these bloody drunken drivers in public and seize the buses.
You disowned your trusted soldier kasab.  Osama remained in your country and you did not resist when they were captured alive by american forces in your own country.  Hence world knows that your country is full of pigs and you have been in denial mode and you will perish one day and will be wiped out of the globe
Duplicate Gandhi...
He doesn't deserve train too.
There are  no two power centres in the centre at present .As was during your rule.Hence govt is performing well. Beyond your imagination.
Yeah I was infact wondering if she even understands what neo feminism is all about . I doubt if she understands the concept completely.  Having said that I also feel there is too much scrutiny she is being subjected to. I don't understand why is everone obsessing over her so much .Leaving her alone probably would be the right thing to do ?

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.  http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Yeah!  Very true  but I think u don't know these Pakistanis are coward they feel happiness in these!  They nurture terrorism in their country,  they are so jobless and coward tht they keep finding ways to mess with India,  tht's why inside their country poor,  innocent children are killed by their own terrorists,  instead of thinking about development they keep finding ways to throw bomb and kill people!  They are kids,  they should grow up!
Indian express is an anti Hindu publication ..always biased..!!!!
Now Kejriwal comments, those 45% who doesn't come out for voting , they boycott EVM.. hahahaha... Mr Arvind Ji, AAP is over
Killing people be it Sanghi or Red can't be an affair of a particular state. The Left must be made accountable for the killings.
You are right Kuldeep Ji but it is not them alone,some rats were consumed by those Hindu brothers also who left on Jagmohan's advice,why and how you know.I wish all our Hindu brothers back in valley and may God let us together live in peace.

Corruption is spread in this country like blood cancer. If one has cancer at a particular location in the body, we can get rid of cancer by removing that part. If whole body is affected by cancer, how difficult it would be to remove cancer from the body?

Modiji lets focus on the Employment and Controlled Privatization along with Demonetaization
Whatever you say is correct from point of humanity but not support reality. If we give away Kashmir to Pakistan problem will not be solved. There are Hindus Sikh Shia also as well some Kashmiri Muslim who don't want to go with Pakistan . Will Pakistan allow free country never we already allowed them 1947. But 75 year we r protecting them under UN resolution from Pakistan n supported if it will merge with india after referendum but in that case also many Pandit n non Muslim hav forceful expelled n genocides to make them majority. Only solution if pak will free Kashmir.
I strongly condemn killing of Indian soldiers.Humanity has died it is shameful act.

Who is responsible for corruption in this Country . It is politicians n their parties.Politicians would continue to take advantage of the loopholes obtaining in our system to promote parties n encourage their children to take to politics.Politics is a profession in this Country and not for service.The system encouraged. While we are with PM for his bold step care should have been taken to see that minimum inconvenience is caused to Sr Citizens,Women and Rural Society. Banks should have been advised to work for 7 days in week with no holidays for 3 months from the date of announcement.One day in a week should have been reserved for Sr.Citizens and one day exclusively for women. It is not late to introduce Pls do to get our full support for demonetisation

There was another American who jumped in and got injured to save this guy(not sure how many Indians will do that for a stranger). If we see one example and start calling everyone terrorist , are we any different from the shooter.
I'm eagerly waiting for the day when Airtel gets a taste of its shady practices.    It's really sad how TRAI continues to shield the big shot Mittal while he merrily loots the public with deceiving tariffs, inflated bills and poorest network.  By the way,  Vodafone scrapped roaming charges months ago, so perhaps the media should act a little less blind and stop giving some companies fodder for publicity.

Why is it that most of the posts these days are asking students to chill out instead of working hard when they can. Because you chose to pick up the answer of someone trying to dropout over 100 other answers who made it big from IITs. Kind of shameful.

There is a widespread misconception that working mothers are working for becoming a CEO.... It's nt the case they are struggling to meet the ends so that thier kid also have the best in live.... While at office all mothers think about thier kids what they ate what they doing ....  Feeling of mother dosent change with stay at mom or working ... Mother is mother always... And no one is superior over other... It's the circumstances that makes make somr one stay at mom or other working sooo ita purely individual opinion .... If ur daughter works when she grows up and handles family will anyone still give gyan... So let mothers decide what is best rather than stereotyping

After Modi became PM, these are happening, 1. The economy is going down the drain 2. Pakistan is killing soldiers at its whim 3. Kashmir has returned back to the 1990s 4. Naxals are on rampage. 5. Nepal and Srilanka are now friends of China. 6. Cows safety and medical treatment are more important than our women and children safety 7. Anti national voices have gone up etc
Media we want to see the first part as well before people start judging who is right n wrong
Rekha Banerji U diverted from my question. How can Muslims be happy when u see every other day innocent muslims getting lynched by hindutva mobs. The criminals don't even get punished that is why it is happening with impunity.

There are many reasons why women choose to work, money may be just one of them and may be not even one of them. Why to be judgmental about what is right and what is wrong? Each to its own. Working mothers can also be great mothers and stay at home moms can be also not so great mothers. There cannot be any generalisation based on what women choose to do in their life
The inability of the government to protect all women is the actual reason for the rise of violence against women.  first put your house in order

Why he never spoke in parliament... he should have talked all this in parliament and should have answered the question. What nation has achieved by this move, how much black money has been declared by hoarders and how many have been caught and brought to books, how many big industrialist and corporates and politicians and big govt officials declared their black money...  Black money is still being generated and some of it is being caught everyday and a lot of BJP members themselves are being caught - this shows that this move will never be able to control future generation of black money.  Black money should be wiped out, hoarders should be punished but this move will deliver non of that. It is like, to treat cancer doctor is prescribing cough & cold medicine.   This is will not solve the problem of our nation.

Akbar conquered Kashmir in 1587 AD. During his mughal rule the Hindus enjoyed security of person and property and were allotted high government posts. It was he, who, pleased with their intelligence, gave them the surname Pandit.[16] The Mughals rule was followed by that of Afghans. Gradually, many Kashmiris converted to Islam, leaving smaller population of Kashmiri Pandits who still practiced the Shaivite religion. Not much was done to win back the converts to Hinduism. The majority, though still remained Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir. Fact!!
Oh really?? I think you are investigating this case even more better than the police??

The people of India shouldn't allow this terrorist in their country.  The only thing he will bring to India bad reputation. Any bilateral business % goes to ISIS  DAESH from Erdogan side. .   Interestingly he made this speech in India about Khilafat which's the dream of his terrorist ISIS proxies too.  ""President Erdogan said that he was delighted to accept the honorary degree from a university which has played a significant role not only in India's freedom movement but has also supported the >Khilafat< movement in the 1920s, while standing by the Turkish people and its founders."" Although not sure which so called ""world-peace"" they are talking about! It's for sure it's not our world/ planet. The only thing this Erdogan contributed in our world has so long been terrorism and destruction.   http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jamia-millia-islamia-turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-doctorate/1/943255.html

This is exactly 'blowing of hooters ahead of a sinking ship'.
Do not even try commenting if you're not one. Well stop there, kid.
very sad ....
I think it was very obvious that AAP got shock of their life when the Demonetization was announced. If you go back and check, they didn't give any reaction for full 36 Hours - obvious super shocker and taking stock of the damage. :-) !! Afterwards, they recouped and started blaming Modi with utter frustration and anger. That was an indication that the move directly impacted them badly!! Now it is more open with all these hawala and shell company linkages :-) !!

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Student protests such as those seen in JNU, Hyderabad University and Jadavpur University can only be countered by reviving nationalism and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose‚Äôs legacy is the best way to achieve it, Major General (retired) G D Bakshi said at a seminar organised by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) on Wednesday. Bakshi, who was speaking at the inaugural session of the three-day seminar on ‚ÄòIndian National Army (INA) and its contribution to India‚Äôs independence‚Äô, said Bose was the only reason the British left India.

How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly ""legal"" steps? Answer:- -> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party] -> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people. [According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.] -> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account. [No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax] -> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white. [Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money] ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!! *Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process teach you about how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.  Isn't it fascinating?

I think Arvind Kejriwal should make it clear once and for all that he is not exactly waiting for a character certificate from the Sarkari Saint that is Anna Hazare. The AAP party has had no real truck with Anna ever since its inception and draws none of its moral sustenance from this gutless pseudo-crusader. So just because they were co-travelers once when AK made the serious mistake of assuming that this man was a genuinely apolitical activist, he is not beholden to this RSS stooge for all time to come.
Sagar Chavan r u jealous of successful woman
Dear Anna So AAP is a lost cause. Fine move on. What is your plan to restore Lokpal? Or are you now resigned to sleeping with the enemy?
Yeah it is changing ppl r dying without money and the rich r getting richer coz the poor are the ones standing in line at ATM/banks and other places of money exchange is the nation only made fr the middle class n lower class wht abt the big time businessmen where did anyome see them being part of the change standing in line a new born dies coz hospital does not give admission well tht was the new born victim this unplanned change
Sir still AAP is better option for poor and middle class compare to dacoit BJP and corrupt Congress
What measure have your government taken to help poor who don't have a bank account and are in great trouble due to demonetisation ,please do think of them also ,they don't have mobile phone ,neither do they know what is digital payment

Not justified for common man under hardship. Had high hopes towards this government to perform professionally. But this is adhoc action as arrow just released without aiming for the enemies.

He did not lay foundation of bjp or congress, but AAP and kejriwal. He supported kejriwal because he said he would do honest politics. If you have to compare with existing parties that too in how much corrupt kejri is than other parties, then why such hypocricy. Just name the party as Khas Aadmi party or another congress-2

Looks like u dont live near to ny mosque.
Dear Sony nigam  ,   Do u know how safe it feel when u hear Azan in the morning ? Thieves and evil doers on road run away thinking that now worshippers will be up and on the way to mosques .   Lots of people( vendors , beggars, stray irrespective of religions ) who don't have hi-tech mobiles to put alarm on , rely on Azan to wake up in the morning to start their day for food . On an average Azan lasts for 1 minutes 30 seconds . Which is a call for prayers for muslims to wake up and remember God .    1minutes and 30 seconds , is also not we are tolerant of now ? We as an Indians boast about being rich in culture and religions . If We start banning this Azan, bhajan Kirtan , or morning chanting in gurudwaras you know how depressing our morning could get .   I am a Muslim and whenever I used to walk across the gurudwara in the morning , I used to peep in to admire how they start their morning with chanting and meditation. It's so soothing to the ears . I miss that india where we admire each other religions !
Govt has to care of Army more than RSS . Else it will be RSS vs Indian Army showdown ?

Kasab's case ran for many years and he was given proper opportunity to defend despite of having that CCTV footage. That shows the power of Indian judiciary.
Why Indian Media not supporting Indian Prime Minister ? Why they are showing long ques of Bank  ?  Some thing is wrong ............
PC has a cunning ability to conceal their systematic, and generation failure of nation's economic growth but to blame others while trying to do so, gradually. Two things in India prevalent are  subsidies and concessions. Both are corrupt orientated and noncompetitive. For all politicians, pseudo secular, left groups, demand for subsidy orientated programs for all rural, and urban people. All schemes of 100000 lakh crores are declared in each budget but poorly implemented through central agencies constituted by unprofessional, political, official, and middlemen nexus, who always fancy of corruption than the success of these schemes. Second our corporate groups, who wants concession of reduced corporate tax and excise/custom duty only without competition at par world standards. Those who challenge these groups may succeed to build India. Modi was looking for only whether he will break all conventional style of development approaches rather take  bold initiatives. Demonetization may be first step to make public use and transact their money through legal ways and transfer economy more formal without indirect control of black money holders as at present. Chidambaram could not do so nor tried to so, is it?
thank god you explain otherwise.. gauge rakshak with talwars on their way.........

Arrogance of communists and the so-called-elitism should be brought to check by voting them out of power like in W Bengal. The only learning from W Bengal is that Congress should not be given power as TMC has been involved in a lot of corruption too.  Who thought Mamta could paint crore worthy painting? Similarly Lavlin is also a pending case for Communists.  Communists are also for minority appeasement and dividing the nation. Lets hope they are cleaned up like in Russia.

Shiv Sena has lost it. Uddhav thakrey  could have earned some points by mentioning that this said minister did wrong and we respect the common man of nation and etc etc. By doing this they are only harming their image. Their real vent is against NAMO and hence they are doing what congress has been doing,  of not allowing parliament to function. ..but this issue and this man ....SS got to rethink.
Who??? Did not mention no names it was a general comment. Don't like it fine

Infact the only thing u can compare this to is ironically the bloody rise of Christianity and Islam over the course of history. No wonder u left wingers are bedfellows of Islamists. You do have a lot in common.

Dr. Raghu Ram Rajan was defenitely an intellectual and genius. That is the reason he became Indias RBI governor. But when it comes to performance, I think, he could not deliver what India expected of him. He took charge as RBI givernor when India was on a take off line. But the governor failed to press the accelerator . I think he was rather keeping his feet on the brake.  All genius are negatively oriented.
As far as the point is concerned .. any thief can enter in ur country from LoC n attack on u n kill BsF jawan  .. wow .. isnt it somethng amazing..  so u can say pakistan also did a surgical strike bt with evidence.. ri8 ??
Motherhood is instinctive. Allah says in Quran ""Your wives are a tilth for you"". Only Islam gives women their rights. All other ""isms"" exploit them for consumerism.  Secular govts promote feminism so they can tax both the genders and control the children.

In our case we were claiming we did it n also all big country shown there support after knowledge from their satellite  Here our gov saying yes but your army chief saying we didn't do anything n no other country accepting this happend this means our strategy of army want to take advantage of this to attack on.

Why don't Hindus living in UAE and Saudia never complain about this forced religiousness? It's because they are used to it.  Calls for prayer from any religion should not be considered as an annoyance.
Mr. Modi's claim seems totally ironical esp in country like India, where, there are no family planning; 35% ppl are illiterate, unemployment & corruption. Above all, every govt which comes in power wants ppl to breed more & more, so that the issues like unemployment, corruption, crimes, hunger, homelessness, couldn't be ended; & their vote bank remain secure.
Only targeting and complaining???  See Pehlu Khan. You are lucky, Maya.

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.
And bury all the bodies of those who have died because of demonetization in a place where no one gets a smell of it.

Hate for modi doesnt mean you have to be anti everything govt does. After all what has congress done for poor, downtrodden and minorities? 70 years in independence..if they proudly stand and say we are protesting for poor - then they should be ashamed of their governance. Economic prosperity+ distribution of wealth is only way. I don't get it. People of your community should be the ones who should have been fed up with Congress, mamta etc and their false promises of bringing prosperity. their game is not to win by prosperity but by bringing fear of the alternative- and you guys have bought it hook, line and sinker.

Yes you are correct. But i don't understand why our Government responded at this. This case might have long gone if they never responded. Personally i don't know what ICJ is and i am not even interested to know about it. Only thing i am interested in is that public execution of this terrorist.

Yes sir u r absolutely right all hindu festivals dont happen 5 times a day, but when they happen they happen with outburst causing incovinience to almost all human beings whether it is hindu, muslim, sikh, christian but no one ever complaint about it because we enjoy together we dance in ganesh chaturthi, burn crackers together celebrate christmas together and have shirkhurma in ramazan we all are one family. Dont divide us on religious background, azan is a process to call everyone to prayer and let everyone know the time of prayer because we cant set alarm for it as it changes with sun rise and sunset. We have always been together in flying kites and causing problems to birds, we have always been together in causing fire and noise pollution in diwali, we have always been together in playing with artificial colors and water wastage in holi, we have always been together in band baja on ganesh chaturti, we together had ramazan sweet, we celebrated christmas together lets be together on azan also dont know someday we will be benefitted by it.

If he's so anti muslim then I wonder how muslims are living happily in his constituency???
Modi Ji execution is your strength yet in demonetization execution is poor. Also the farmer in your govt is really suffering. Not much for farmers enablement and survival.

Really..?? I dont think.. IITs are overrated.. even if people might argue that... JEE doesnt test your brains,intelligence.. it tests something far more important.. the real ingredient for success-sincerity..  Plus it gifts you a great platform to build your career..! This guys just gt defeated.. Most people dont.. Most people come out of their cocoon.. and spread their wings.. and soar to new heights!!! Most importantly it throws at you different challenges.. and help you build your character!! Yourself.. a successful person..  PS:Not an IITian.. no sour grapes.
This launch is certainly not for the faint hearted xP

So Madam Mira says that working mothers treat their kids like puppies ? A mother's love is a mother's love- wthr she spends one hr or twenty four with a child.   Not everyone is married to a celebrity. Many women have to work ti support their husbands and ensure a decent future for the kid.   Madam, you are insulting them by saying that they treat the kids like puppies.  *To add* You decide to bring a baby into the world and into your family. It is the same with puppies or any other pet for that matter.  Your pet is not for your recreation that you would spend one hour with them and run away. People who really bond with their pets treat them like their own kids.  Obviously you neither know much about keeping pets nor about motherhood.
He has selective deafness...He has never heard bhajans or arti or jagrata in Mandir, only azan from mosque

I found Triple Talaq and Halala regressive but it offended my brothers on left and my Muslim brothers so now I bat for full Sharia for Muslims except punishment for apostates and heretics.
True. What I also found disturbing was early morning singing/chanting processions specially in the North. They don't let you sleep in the morning.
He is right Y others shud suffer

No Rafi RSS never supported British . Just think what Islam is all about , it is about Islam and Islammyat , everything else is fly in the milk so as to speak . RSS in a Hindu majority nation is about Hindu , Hinduism and Hindustan .  About Gandhi assassination , yes it was justified considering the time it occurred. The nation is partition on both sides and massacred Hindus are arriving from the East and Wast . When Hindus and Sikhs retaliated , Gandhi went on his usual fast unto death . Did that stop Muslim mayhem ?

It is election time, hence you will see the usual "" Arvind let down"" lines from Anna Hazare...sometimes I wonder if Anna has really said anything at all...or is media putting words in his mouth
People who are saying drama n all... Please open your eyes and see he did something  at least.... Better than before at least he did...
Why doesn't he speak the same in the parliament? Is he scared of spontaneousness?

http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/  Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake

Even our road side chai wala uses sms transfer and this is nothing new it's been like this for 2 to 3 years now. Please do not blame the government or the banks because people don't want to change.

Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù,  ‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù   ‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù  If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us  India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face. China Claim South China Sea  China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly  Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off  India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty  If China Can Do For Their Mother Land  Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do) Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.

Cow is a beef animal. Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse & buffalo‚Äù Read the excerpt of beef eating in Ancient India found in scriptures. Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù One of the greatest scholar and propagator of Hinduism Swami Vivekanand says,‚ÄúYou will be surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rites and rituals, a man cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef http://indiaopines.com/beef-ban-hindu-scriptures-maharashtra-politics/

PAYTM is a unscrupulous vendor see my experience : I Paid through Paytm ( order no. 2532865244) payment of Rs.590/- towards my CESC Electricity Bill for CESC Consumer ID-60000208248 on January 6 morning, but after 5 days , it is still showing PROCESSING, I have raised numerous tickets, but no one is there to reply me. Is it a reliable service ? or birth of mistrust ? I wonder how our Central Government is promoting such scrap?
Just saw this news * read 1dt comment.  *smiled  and  thought  it must be ndtv or hindustantimes.  * scrolled  up and checked.. Ndtv.  * laughed and said saeed.. Ye madharchod nhi sudrege.  *moved on.
U guys can crack jokes but can't take the cridibility of Indian armed force.... already war with Pak is one sided ie 4 -0 ....
These media fellows have time to dissect one's social media profile,but none of spineless jokers has the guts to question as to why and how a convict like Lalu Yadav is roaming outside and running a Government.
