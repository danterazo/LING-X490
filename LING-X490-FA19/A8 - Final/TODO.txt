IDEAs:
1. Resample on Kaggle since its huge. Boost by filtering on a topic and creating a list of words/hashtags (i.e. soccer: ["goalie", "manchester"]). Compare to random sampling
	- repeat Waseem vs. Founta
	- sample vs. random
	- repo: lexicon-of-abusive-words from bias paper (github page: extended and otherwise). dict: list of abusive words
		- if one or more words appear, then its explicit; otherwise implicit
		- segment lexicon
	- its okay to fail in research

resume:
- Undergrad Researcher
	- expertise in abusive language detection

education:
- MS CompLing, PhD available
